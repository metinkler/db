NAME: Ricochet Robots
DESCRIPTION:
Ricochet Robots is less of a game and more of a puzzle, which explains why there's such an odd number of solutions possible. There's a four-piece modular board that forms a large room with walls spread around the board. There are also color-coded targets on boards. Placed on top of the surface are four robots. The idea for each turn/puzzle is to get the like-colored robot to a randomly selected target. The trick is that once a robot starts moving, it will continue to move until a wall or another robot stops it. Therefore, players are seeking a sequence of moves for the robots that will enable them to move the required robot to the target in the fewest moves.

NAME: Giganten
DESCRIPTION:
Besides attempting to find oil in dusty Texas, players must also try to outbid one another for sales contracts in the oil industry.  An oilfield with drilling sites scattered about is spread out before the players, who take their trucks out trying to grab those sites as quickly as possible.

Three groups of tiles are laid over the drilling sites, giving a range of value for each site once it has been reached by a player.  The deeper a site is into the field the greater its overall yield. But players have to weigh this against creating a constant supply from the smaller yields that are closer at the beginning of the game.

Once oil has been produced, players can attempt to sell it on the market. But there are only three companies, and with four players this means that one player will be shut out each turn.  Bidding has an interesting element to it in that player's bidding pools are hidden from one another, making it difficult to tell whether a player is bluffing.

NAME: Vinci
DESCRIPTION:
Along the lines of History of the World by Avalon Hill, players cycle through a series of European civilizations as they attempt to score the most points using the civilization's special powers.  The game is set in Europe and each player is provided with a pool of wooden tokens to represent their civilizations.  Each player selects a combination of civilization tiles, which give his civilization special abilities or characteristics.  Players enlarge their empires through territorial expansion, often at the expense of other players.  The key to the game lies in choosing when to allow your active civilization to go into decline in order to select a new one which will generate more points.  Play continues with the cycling of civilizations until a certain score is reached, whereupon final rounds are played and a victor is determined.

The board is laid out with a random bunch of fossil pieces and players have to take turns moving a stone about the field to a location where they want to pick up a fossil piece.  However, every movement costs them prestige points so they have to weigh carefully if the fossil is worth the effort.

NAME: Samurai
DESCRIPTION:
(from the back of the box:)

You are now back in time-12th through 17th century Japan, to be exact. Your objective: the exalted title of "Shogun". As "Shogun", you will have the right to enforce the emperor's will, and become the real ruler of Japan.

Samurai allows you to take control of Japan. In medieval Japan, the central government of the emperor was dissolved. He become a powerless figurehead while various clans competed to take control of the country. 
These clans were similar to the noble houses of Europe; and their leaders the equivalent of medieval Dukes, Barons, Counts, and the like. 
Using formldable samurai warriors, the clans waged endless wars across the major islands of the Japanese archipelago.

Concept of Play 
Each player controls a clan, with one or more lords. Each lord has a province representing his personal "fief" or home, and often has additional holdings of troops, titles, ships, castles, and more provinces.

The game is played in 20 turns, each representing a pace of historical events running between a few months to a few years. In each turn, moves are conducted on a mapboard that portrays the three major islands of Japan.

The playing pieces-360 in all-include Samurai Lords, clan control markers, holdings and title counters, troops, garrisons, and more; all explained in the easy­ to-follow prose of the 18-page rules folder.

Many Games in One 
An excellent game for 2 to 8 players. Samurai is suitable for beginning and intermedlate play, with plenty of optional rules and strategic options for even the expert. And for the really hard-core power-politics fanatics, special rules create a nearly "perpetual" game representing tho true ebb and flow of Japanese feudal confilct. 
Samurai includes a variety of playing aids to make learning and playing the game truly an effortless task. The rules manual contains historical background and designer's notes that offer the player the full flavor and authenticity of what medieval conflict was all about in the age of the "Shogun" struggles.


(BGG description:)

Samurai is a game about warfare and politics in feudal Japan. The aim of the game is to gain the title "Shogun" by game end. To become Shogun, the player has to gain control of two out of four Imperial Articles scattered across the mapboard. These are: the Emperor, The Heir, The Imperial Regalia and Kyoto Castle.

Playing pieces are the samurai lords of various houses. Each lord has a home province which provides him with troops. Additional troops may be added through offices, other provinces, castles, etc.

NAME: Joan of Arc
DESCRIPTION:
Joan of Arc, a game of "Conquest and Perfidy in the Kingdom of France", deals with the conflicts in France during the Hundred Years' War.  It's a multiplayer wargame with a card-driven combat system and a political layer that players must contend with.

For just over one hundred years England and France battled over who would sit on the French throne. Even within France itself factions developed, putting forth their own candidates challenging the rights of the Dauphin. From this struggle heroes emerged, notably the Black Prince and Jeanne d'Arc, The Maid of Orleans. Tremendous battles were fought at Crecy, Poitiers and Agincourt, yet their impact on the war was ephemeral. Long sieges followed short campaigns, bands of the notorious Free Companies, temporarily unemployed, marauded across the countryside in search of rapine and plunder. Complicating matters, both famine and plague poisoned the seasons. All in all, 'twas a grand time!

Components:

1 mounted game board 
80 cards (a la Tarot) 
20 resin cast castles and 10 resin cast strongholds 
die-cut coin markers and garrisons representing the factions of France, England, Navarre, Brittany, Flanders and Burgandy.

All kinds of bits come in this package—walls, castles, knights, and a gorgeous game board that allows for variable setups.

Set in ancient times, Conquest has players utilizing troops, cavalry, chariots, elephants and ships to try to capture their opponents' fortifications or occupy the "quest" locations.  The map is designed for point-to-point movement, and play hinges on a pool of action points that each side uses to move its different units.  Conquest comes in two versions, one designed for four players and one designed exclusively for two.

DESCRIPTION:
Bollox is easy to learn as there are only two rules. Playing the game of Bollox, well, is a bit trickier.

Your objective? Get five pieces in a row. Sounds easy, right?

Rule One: Black plays first. Still sounds easy? Not so fast!

Rule Two: The seemingly sudden 'Sandwich Move'. Just like it sounds, when you entrap two of your opponent's pieces between two of your own, you get to "evict" one of your opponent's pieces. This 'Sandwich Move' really does "bollox up" the game plan of the unwary player. Often the Sandwich Move can completely turn the game around and give you a dazzling win.

NAME: Civilization
DESCRIPTION:
CIVILIZATION is a game of skill for 2 to 7 players.  It covers the development of ancient civilizations from the invention of agriculture c. 8000 B.C. to the emergence of Rome around the middle of the third century B.C.  Each player leads a nation of peoples over a map board of the Eastern Mediterranean and Near East as they attempt to carve a niche for themselves and their culture.

Although battles and territorial strategy are important, this is not a war game because it is not won by battle or conquest.  Instead, the object of play is to gain a level of overall advancement involving cultural, economic, and political factors so that such conflicts that do arise are a result of rivalry and land shortage rather than a desire to eliminate other players.  Nomad and farmer, warrior and merchant, artisan and citizen all have an essential part to play in the development of civilization.  It is the player who most effectively changes emphasis between these various outlooks who will achieve the best balance - and win.

(from the Introduction to the Avalon Hill edition rulebook)

This game has a huge following and is widely regarded as one of the best games about ancient civilizations.  Each player takes on the role of leader of an ancient civilization, such as the Illyrians or Babylonians.  Your task is to guide your people through the ages by expanding your empire and using its proceeds to finance new technological advances, such as Literacy, Metalworking, or Law.  The advancements help your civilization better cope with its problems as well as help bring new advancements.

Civilization is widely thought to be the first game ever to incorporate a "technology tree," allowing players to gain certain items and abilities only after particular other items were obtained.  This influential mechanism has been adopted by countless other board games, card games, and computer games.

This board game masquerading as a card game is about a conflict between two factions, the Rose and the Eagle. In each turn, players attempt to change the allegiance of one land district, contributing power cards to swing the conflict in their favor. Players also choose roles such as Diplomat, Traitor, and Builder that give them special abilities for that turn. The most potentially devastating role is that of the Verräter, or Traitor, which allows the player to change allegiances just as the conflict begins. Points are awarded for winning over districts, for taking certain roles, and for building counting-houses.

The party game Apples to Apples consists of two decks of cards: Things and Descriptions. Each round, the active player draws a Description card (which features an adjective like "Hairy" or "Smarmy") from the deck, then the other players each secretly choose the Thing card in hand that best matches that description and plays it face-down on the table. The active player then reveals these cards and chooses the Thing card that, in his opinion, best matches the Description card, which he awards to whoever played that Thing card. This player becomes the new active player for the next round.

Once a player has won a pre-determined number of Description cards, that player wins.

The dealer continues dealing cards to players, eventually giving them 'ground' cards.  But on the way down players can do all kinds of nasty stuff to each other to ensure their relative longevity.

When a player, on their turn with no outstanding loans, has a mix of market share and cash on hand that equals or exceeds the winning target (which varies with number of players), that player wins.

NAME: EastFront
DESCRIPTION:
EastFront details the conflict between Germany and the Soviet Union during WWII.  Players have to contend with production, supply, command control and weather to try and break the other sides' lines.  Several scenarios cover every major point of the war.  The game comes with a fantastic detailed map of Eastern Europe and Russia printed on card and many wooden blocks for the units.  This is one section of the complete EuroFront series that covers the entire European conflict of WWII.

This title uses Columbia Games Block system.  While there are variations in the rule sets, all of their games are based on the block system.  Basically this means that rather than using the traditional  counters to represent units on the map the game uses wooden blocks that stand upright with unit details only shown on one side.  This does two things:  First it provides an easy way of producing a "fog of war" because your opponent can not tell, save through good memory, what type of unit a specific piece is or its current strength.  Second, having the blocks stand on end allows the possibility of rotating a block so the current strength is the top number.  Although most war games have some type of mechanism that lets units take steps in their overall strength, counters normally have at most two steps because they only have two sides.  Blocks, however, have four so you can easily keep track of twice the amount of detail that many other war games provide.  With the use of blocks Columbia has provided a way of adding a good deal of depth to their war games without adding complex layers of bookkeeping, allowing interesting and relatively short sessions of play.

With the use of blocks Columbia has provided a way of adding a good deal of depth to their war games without adding further complex layers of bookkeeping and thus allow for interesting and relatively short sessions of play.

All artwork and graphics in the game Sam Grant was created by RPG/Historical artist,  Eric Hotz.

NAME: Rommel in the Desert
DESCRIPTION:
Rommel in the Desert is a pre-"Front" game touching on the conflict between the British and Germans in North Africa during WWII. A game of maneuver, each side has to move with precision and know when to strike, since a cut in supply spells disaster for either side. The supply system is card driven. The game comes with a map of North Africa and 100 wooden blocks to represent the British and Germans.

This title uses Columbia Games Block system. While there are variations in the rule sets for each of their games none the less all of their games are based on block system. Basically this means that rather than the traditional use of counters to represent units on the map the game instead uses wooden blocks that stand upright and with unit details only shown on one side of the blocks. This does two things: First it provides an easy way of producing a "fog of war" because your opponent can not tell, save through good memory, what type of unit a specific piece is and its current strength. Second, by having the blocks stand on end it provides a way to keep track of a units strength by rotating the block so the current strength is the top number. Most war games have some type of mechanism that lets units take steps in their overall strength. Counters normally have at most two steps because of they only have two sides, however blocks have four and so now you can easily keep track of twice the amount of detail that many other war games provide. With the use of blocks Columbia has provided a way of adding a good deal of depth to their war games without adding further complex layers of bookkeeping and thus allow for interesting and relatively short sessions of play.

NAME: Quebec 1759
DESCRIPTION:
Quebec 1759 is a small, simple and short war game covering the conflict between the British and the French in Canada during the French and Indian War. The game comes with a gorgeous map drawn in the style of the period. Movement is conducted via a point-to-point system following the roads and towns in the area around Quebec. The game comes with handfuls of blocks to represent the British and French units.

This title uses Columbia Games Block system. While there are variations in the rule sets, all of their games are based on the block system. Basically this means that rather than using the traditional counters to represent units on the map the game uses wooden blocks that stand upright with unit details only shown on one side.

NAME: Victory:  The Blocks of War
DESCRIPTION:
Victory: The Blocks of War is a Block game published in 1998 by Columbia Games.  It is a generic war game played on modular maps with World War II units.  The game uses a stripped down Front system, with the whole command control element removed and simplified movement and unit production.  Block sets for blue and red players and several maps are included in the base game.

There are many supplements available, including basic block sets for four additional colors (black, orange, green, and gray), ten-unit elite sets for each color, maps with various terrain, and a logistics expansion which provides a twist on production and adds other strategic elements to the game.

NAME: Torres
DESCRIPTION:
Torres is an abstract game of resource management and tactical pawn movement.  Players are attempting to build up castles and position their knights to score the most points each turn.  Players have a limited supply of knights and action cards that allow special actions to be taken.  Efficient use of pieces and cards, along with a thoughtful awareness of future possibilities, is the heart of this game.

Torres is considered by many to be an informal member of what is referred to as the Mask Trilogy.

NAME: Paths of Glory
DESCRIPTION:
(from GMT Games' website:)

They called it the Great War. In over four years of titanic struggle, the ancient Europe of Kings and Emperors tore itself to pieces, giving birth to our own violent modern age. The bloody battles fought in the trenches of the Western Front, the icy plains of Poland, the mountains of the Balkans, and the deserts of Arabia, shaped the world we know today. We are all orphans of the Great War.

Paths of Glory: The First World War, designed by six-time Charles S. Roberts awards winner, Ted Raicer, allows players to step into the shoes of the monarchs and marshals who triumphed and bungled from 1914 to 1918. As the Central Powers you must use the advantage of interior lines and the fighting skill of the Imperial German Army to win your rightful 'place in the sun.' As the Entente Powers (Allies) you must bring your greater numbers to bear to put an end to German militarism and ensure this is the war 'to end all wars.' Both players will find their generalship and strategic abilities put to the test as Paths of Glory's innovative game systems let you recreate all the dramatic events of World War I.

Components:

     316 full-color die-cut counters:
         176 5/8” die cut counters
         140 1/2” die cut counters
    
     One 22x34" full-color mapsheet showing most of Europe and the Near East
     110 Strategy Cards
     32-page Rule Book including sample game replay (21 pages of actual rules)
     Two Player Reference Cards

(BGG description:)

Following in the footsteps of We the People, Hannibal: Rome vs. Carthage, Successors (second edition), and For the People, Paths of Glory utilizes a similar card-driven system.  The game covers WWI from its outbreak to American intervention and spans all of Europe and the Middle East.  Not only is the game innovative, but it also plays fast, usually within just an evening.

While the game itself has all of the normal expectations of a wargame, with various units, CRT charts and period chrome, at heart the game rests within the card play.  Players are given a hand of cards to play out six sub-phases of a turn.  Each sub-phase allows for the use of a card or a pass with a minimal movement of units.  Each card has four possible uses: operational movement, strategic movement, special events, and replacement points.  The cardplay forces players to constantly make tough decsions as they feel that they need to do a little bit of everything but they can only do one thing at a time.  How you play your cards will decide to a large degree the outcome of the war.

NAME: El Grande
DESCRIPTION:
In this award-winning game, players take on the roles of Grandes in medieval Spain.  The king's power is flagging, and these powerful lords are vying for control of the various regions.  To that end, you draft caballeros (knights in the form of colored cubes) into your court and subsequently move them onto the board to help seize control of regions.  After every third round, the regions are scored, and after the ninth round, the player with the most points is the winner.

In each of the nine rounds, you select one of your 13 power cards to determine turn order as well as the number of caballeros you get to move from the provinces (general supply) into your court (personal supply).

A turn then consists of selecting one of five action cards which allow variations to the rules and additional scoring opportunities in addition to determining how many caballeros to move from your court to one or more of the regions on the board (or into the castillo - a secretive tower). Normally, you may only place your caballeros into regions adjacent to the one containing the king pawn. The one hard and fast rule in El Grande is that nothing may move into or out of the king's region. One of the five action cards that is always available each round allows you to move the king to a new region. The other four action cards varying from round to round.

The goal is to have a caballero majority in as many regions (and the castillo) as possible during a scoring round. Following the scoring of the castillo, you place any cubes you had stashed there into the region you had secretly indicated on your region dial. Each region is then scored individually according to a table printed in that region. Two-point bonuses are awarded for having sole majority in the region containing your Grande (large cube) and in the region containing the king.

NAME: Union Pacific
DESCRIPTION:
Union Pacific is a train-themed stock market game.  On each turn, players must choose between expanding a company to increase its value and adding a share of stock to their hand, or playing stock onto the table from their hand to increase their ownership of one or two companies.  There are four semi-random scoring events, in which the first and second place share holder in each company are paid dividends.  Only stock that has been previously played onto the table is considered during the scoring rounds.   Union Pacific is a special company whose shares are claimed according to special rules.  Union Pacific is not represented on the board but instead pays dividends to all share holders according to a fixed progression chart.  Money is only used to track victory conditions and cannot be spent during the game.  The winner is the player with the most money at the end of the game.

NAME: Igel Ärgern
DESCRIPTION:
Translated literally, the title means "Hedgehog Irking" (or a bit more loosely, "Annoying the Hedgehogs"), but the game is usually referred to in English as "Hedgehogs in a Hurry." This game gives players several wooden disks (the hedgehogs) to place in one of six rows.  During a turn, you roll a die, optionally move any of your hedgehogs one row left or right, then move any hedgehog (not necessarily yours!) in the row your rolled forward one space.  But watch out for black spaces; hedgehogs caught there can't continue moving until they're in last place.  The first player to get three of their four hedgehogs to the end of the board wins.  Some later versions of this game come with dozens of different variants to keep the game interesting.

NAME: Broadsides and Boarding Parties
DESCRIPTION:
Broadsides and Boarding Parties was the first title in Milton Bradley's Gamemaster series of games.  It is a light tactical war game during the age of sail where two ships face off against one another on the sea.  There are basically two layers to the game, the broadsides portion in which players plot their movement with a deck of cards, attempting to maneuver their ships in such a way that they can fire a volley of cannon balls at the opponent while minimizing the risk of return fire.

The second layer of the game begins when the movement of ships results in them bumping into one another.  In these instances the Boarding Parties portion comes into play.  Here players line up their ships next to one another and attempt to storm the other ship and kill the opposing captain.  Players can only move a limited amount of their units each turn and so some planning is required to hem in the opposing captain.

The components for the game are quite elaborate.  Each player is given a fully detailed plastic ship about a foot long with removable masts.  Also, each player is given a whole crew of little plastic pirate figures, cannon, and captain.  Lastly the board is full color and styled in the period.


Note that the first edition was published in 1982 by Larry Harris, Jr. (Citadel Game Systems) and came in a box similar in size to the Games Workshop Ltd. or Avalon Hill games.  There are no elaborate plastic ships, cannons or playing pieces in the original edition, though.  You get paper maps and cardboard counters.

NAME: Conquest of the Empire
DESCRIPTION:
Conquest of the Empire is part of Milton Bradley's Gamemaster series.  It is set during the Roman Empire and depicts the struggle around the Mediterranean as rival factions attempt to take control of the empire.  Each player plays one of these factions and receives a Caesar figure, several general figures, and ships of a specific color.  Along with these leaders, players utilize a pool of generic units composed of infantry, cavalry, and catapults.  All game pieces are plastic figures.

Players attempt to conquer their neighbors and build up cities and fortifications to increase production of wealth.  Players also may build road networks that allow for faster movement, by all armies.  Along the way players have to contend with rising inflation which makes military units more and more expensive.  Eventually through elimination one player pulls ahead for the win.

NAME: Axis & Allies
DESCRIPTION:
Axis and Allies is the most successful of Milton Bradley's Gamemaster series.

It depicts WWII on a grand scale, full global level. Up to five players can play on two different teams. The Axis which has Germany and Japan, and the Allies which has the USA, the United Kingdom, and the USSR. A full map of the world is provided, broken up in various chunks similar to Risk. The game comes with gobs of plastic miniatures that represent various military units during WWII.  Players have at their disposal infantry, armor, fighters, bombers, battleships, aircraft carriers, submarines, troop transports, anti-air guns, and factories. All of the units perform differently and many have special functions. Players have to work together with their teammates in order to coordinate offenses and decide how best to utilize their production points. Players also have the option of risking production resources on the possibility of developing a super technology that might turn the tide of war.

Axis and Allies was originally published by Nova Games in 1981.

NAME: Fortress America
DESCRIPTION:
Fortress America, originally part of Milton Bradley's Gamemaster series, depicts an alternate near-future in which all of the world attacks and invades the continental United States. From the west arrives hordes of Asian foes; from the south arrives a union of South American countries through Mexico, and from the east lands come legions of Soviets who have taken over all of Europe. America besieged has to rely on the remaining ground and air forces left in the country along with partisan uprisings to defend mom's apple pie.

Up to four players can play Fortress America, one player being the U.S. and up to three others controlling the invading units from a particular direction. Being a near future scenario, the units in the game include conventional infantry, APCs, hovertanks, helicopters, bombers, US partisan units, and special "Star Wars" laser relay systems that fire from space.

The game emphasizes combined arms in that players receive a bonus if infantry, mechanized, and air power are all used in a conflict. For the invading countries, all the units they receive for the game are given at the start so they must manage them wisely. The U.S., however, starts with a skeleton defense and builds up throughout the game through a random deck of cards. Further, the U.S. slowly builds up its Star Wars system, so the longer the invaders are delayed, the more powerful the U.S. becomes both conventionally and through its defense system.

NAME: Detroit-Cleveland Grand Prix
DESCRIPTION:
This game is part of a family which includes Top Race, Daytona 500, and Formel 1.  Players are dealt a hand of cards which have movement numbers for one or more of the cars.  When a card is played, the cars are advanced the number of spaces indicated in order from top to bottom.  However, if the track is blocked, then that movement is lost, so the idea is to use the cards that help your opponents (which you'll likely have to play eventually) only when they won't be able to take advantage of the movement.

NAME: Titan
DESCRIPTION:
This classic game of the Fantasy Monster Slug-a-thon is a standby from the Avalon Hill of yore.  The game still has a very devoted following, which is a tribute to the depth of the various strategies and approaches.  The game is divided into two realms, the masterboard and the battleboards.  On the masterboard, legions of mythical creatures roam about trying to recruit bigger and badder monsters and kill opposing legions in the process.  When a combat occurs, the action moves to the corresponding battleboard type corresponding to the area the fight is taking place in.  After lots of dice are tossed, the army that remains standing is returned to the masterboard with the spoils of war: points.

The points are used to recruit Angels and Archangels and to augment the leader character of the player's army: The Titan.  As the points increase, the Titans become ever more powerful; at game end, the titan is able to kill most other character with a single blow. But be careful: If the Titan dies, the player is out of the game.

The last Titan standing is the ruler of all, and winner of the game.

DESCRIPTION:
Players take on the role of editors in this older German title, choosing stories of various general types (politics, sports, entertainment, etc.) to run in their respective newspapers.  Two factors determine a story's worth: timing and size.  The timing is relevant because the later in the game the story is run the more points it's potentially worth.  But in this game (as in the real world) size is important, because only the biggest story of any given headline will score.

NAME: Colossal Arena
DESCRIPTION:
Colossal Arena/Titan: This is a strategic card game for 2 to 5 players: you play, not as combatants, but as spectators, cheering and betting on the melee ongoing in a fantasy arena/colosseum in which fantasy creatures are pitted against each other in battle!

Each round one of the creatures will die. To decide which unlucky soul will be the victim, players put numbered power cards in front of the creatures, with the lowest one going to the graveyard.  The jockeying for position and strategic diplomacy in playing the numbered power cards can be intense - but what makes this game even more interesting is that the players' place bets throughout the game which will sometimes allow them to use a creature's special power in battle!

The winner at the end of the game is the bettor who's raked in the most winnings - just another day in the life of a fantasy monster gambler.

Titan: The Arena is actually a reworking of a Reiner Knizia game called Grand National Derby, but Avalon Hill's remake was quite significant from a gameplay standpoint.

The Titan: The Arena printing is often confused with its namesake, Titan.  But other than the fact that they both use fantasy creatures as a general theme, there is very little that is similar between the two.

DESCRIPTION:
This game attaches an interesting theme to a fairly standard Rummy framework.  Playing Victims, Suspects, Scenes, and Evidence-melds, players try to build a case against various suspects for the famous Jack the Ripper serial murders.  Whichever suit has the most cards played in it when a player goes out is the guilty party, but if all the Victim cards come out before the end of the game, the Ripper might escape, giving the player who produced that card a significant point allowance.

This is #1 in the Mystery Rummy series.

DESCRIPTION:
This small-publisher game comes with loads of wooden hex-shaped tiles, a hex board, and three pawns.  The object of the game is to move your pawn from one corner of the hex board to the opposite corner.  However, instead of taking your move, you can place a hex tile on the board.  These are used to block your opponent, because while your pawn can always go down any number of hex tiles, it can only step up one level at a time.

DESCRIPTION:
The hexagonal board has several holes in it for the unique playing pieces.  Each player uses sand timers as his pieces, and a turn is simply to move to an adjacent space, flipping the timer in the process.  The number of times that each space on the board can be occupied is limited, but the more central spaces can have more traffic.  The object of the game is simply to have any of your pieces movable when your opponent's pieces are either locked in place, or out of sand.

NAME: Wettstreit der Baumeister
DESCRIPTION:
Jean du PoÃ«l put this game out on the market for about a year before the game's name was changed to Wettstreit der Baumeister in 1998.

This translates to "Contest of the Architects". The game has a beautiful assortment of large, thick tiles to represent the cities. Players bid on a single building tile every turn, with half the proceeds going to the auctioning player. When a player is ready to start construction of his city, the tiles are laid out in order with the single restriction that not two touching tiles are the same type. The building types are city halls, churches, towers, and gates. When the one of the two draw piles is exhausted, the cities are judged for symmetry, with the highest scoring city winning.

Rules apply to either game:

Within two decks of 20 cards are contained the City Wall, Towers and Gates, Churches, City Halls, etc. During play, one of the decks lies face up, the other face down. There are three parts to each player's turn. First, the player rolls a die in an attempt to better his finances (1 to 5 on the die; the sixth side gives a sabotage-counter instead). Second, he alone may look at the top hidden card before he makes an offer on either of the two top cards from the two decks. The other players then bid on the two cards. If the player (the Auctioneer) makes the highest bid, he may take the card and pay the bank. If, on the other hand, one of the other players buys the card, that player pays half the money to the bank and half to the Auctioneer. Third, a player may either build (lay down another card on his city) or sabotage a City Card of another player. The player receiving the sabotage must then pay the value of the card or remove it.

The game ends when either of the decks is depleted.

NAME: Auf Achse
DESCRIPTION:
Auf Achse translates roughly to "On the Road," an appropriate title for this 1987 Spiel des Jahres winner which has players delivering loads of commodities to various German and other European cities. Supply cities and demand cities are determined through card play, and players attempt to get delivery contracts by bidding against one another. Movement is accomplished by rolling a die and then moving little rubberized trucks around an abstracted map which depicts lots of interconnected roads and cities in Germany and surrounding countries.

Re-released in 2007 with new artwork and several rule changes designed to reduce randomness.

NAME: Rheinländer
DESCRIPTION:
This Reiner Knizia game, produced by Hasbro's European division, casts players in the roles of dukes who are trying to establish duchies along the banks of the Rhine River.  Players hold a hand of cards that correspond to numbered plots on each bank, and they place knights in open plots for which they hold the corresponding cards.  After establishing duchies, players attempt to expand them to include more plots of land, as well as buildings - such as castles, cathedrals, and cities. These buildings both add to the value of a duchy and provide their owners with advantages during game play.  Combined with a uniquely Knizia-style scoring system, this game has some very interesting dynamics.

NAME: Condottiere
DESCRIPTION:
It is 13th century Italy. Trade is flourishing between the city-states and the Levant. Venice, Florence, and Genoa are all bursting with wealth. However, each city-state is also plagued with a weak national army, leaving them defenseless against invasion from their envious neighbors. Enter the Condottiere. 
 As veteran English soldiers returned from the Crusades, Italy found itself with an influx of desperate and capable men. These hired swords were contracted to fight for individual city-states by an agreement known as a condotta. The most elite of these men were the mercenary leaders known as the Condottiere.

The object of Condottiere is to acquire four connected provinces in renaissance Italy. To do this players auction off different provinces on the board and bid on these provinces with a hand of cards representing mercenaries, seasons, scarecrows, and political figures. However, unlike standard auctions in which only the highest bidder loses their bid, in Condottiere every player loses their bid.  Players are, in effect, bidding the number of troops they are willing to lose in order to win a province. However, several special effect cards shake the contests up and keep the players guessing.

NAME: Mit List und Tücke
DESCRIPTION:
This trick-taking game has quite a few twists.  Those accustomed to the genre will be particularly thrown off by two aspects: players don't have to follow suit, and the loser of a trick leads the next trick.  Those features, along with an unusual scoring system (you want to be really strong in two suits and really weak in the other two) and the fact that the winner of a trick gets to choose which cards to take, combine to create a very unusual game..

NAME: Ransom
DESCRIPTION:
This game comes inside what looks like a video tape case, which is definitely odd for a board game.  Inside the package are cards for properties on Manhattan island, workers, building materials, and building contracts.  Each turn, players turn over a card and either purchase it outright or auction it to the group.  But when the contracts get bought, players will need to negotiate a deal, because it's very difficult to build a decent sized building on your own.  The deal making is vicious and cutthroat, ergo the name.

The 1995 edition features rules in English, Japanese, German, Spanish and French (see the Tidwell review).

NAME: I'm the Boss!
DESCRIPTION:
Classic negotiation game in which players take turns being "The Boss" arranging deals between specific players on how best to divide piles of money. Players can sabotage or kill deals they're not happy with.

Rarely is a game stripped down to its bare essense as cleanly as I'm the Boss! is. Up to fifteen deals can be made over the course of the game, and a player who is part of a successful deal will receive a certain amount of money.

How much money? Well, that depends on whatever deal is made among the players involved, as negotiated by that round's boss. Complicating matters quite a bit, however, each player has a hand of action cards that can be used to derail negotiations, insert themselves into a deal, take over the role of boss, and otherwise muck with the smooth flow of deal-making that other players had hoped to achieve. Nertz to them! If you want to make a deal, you gotta cut me a share!

Once nine deals have been made, a die is rolled after each subsequent deal to determine whether the game ends (with the odds increasing each time). Victory goes to whoever has the biggest bankroll!

NAME: Guillotine
DESCRIPTION:
The French Revolution is famous in part for the use of the guillotine to put nobles to death, and this is the macabre subject of this light card game.  As executioners pandering to the masses, the players are trying to behead the least popular nobles.  Each day the nobles are lined up and players take turns killing the ones at the front of the line until all the nobles are gone.  However, players are given cards which will manipulate the line order right before 'harvesting,' which is what makes the game interesting.  After three days worth of chopping, the highest total carries the day.

NAME: Ta Yü
DESCRIPTION:
In Ta Yü, a game of connections, one side tries to extend from the starting tile in the center to reach the western and eastern edges of the board while the opposing side tries to reach the northern and southern edges.  On your turn you simply draw a tile and decide where to place it, extending the network of tiles already on the board.

Several refinements make this simple proposition into an engrossing game.  First, each tile is 3x1 (to be played on a 19x19 board) and has exactly three outlets (potential connection points). Second, your score is not simply the number of spots you've reached on one edge added to the number of spots you've reached on the other, but is the product of those two numbers.  So you can't just concentrate on one side and ignore the other, because zero times anything is still zero.  Third, on each side of the board there are three special points which score double if reached, adding a dab of focus to the choices.

Interestingly, you need to play both offense and defense and will often have to decide to which use to put a particular tile.

NAME: Modern Art
DESCRIPTION:
Buying and selling paintings is a very lucrative business, at least that's what Hollywood's led us to believe, and that's the premise of this game.  Five different artists have produced a bunch of paintings, and it's the player's task to be both the buyer and the seller, hopefully making a profit in both roles.  He does this by putting a painting from his hand up for auction each turn.  He gets the money if some other player buys it, but must pay the bank if he buys it for himself.  After each round, paintings are valued by the number of paintings of that type that were sold.  The broker with the most cash after four rounds is the winner.

Part of the Knizia auction trilogy.

NAME: Kingdoms
DESCRIPTION:
Auf Heller und Pfennig takes participants to a medieval marketplace that looks remarkably like a plain matrix for square tiles. Each turn, players place tiles onto the board that modify (either positively or negatively) the amount of money to be made by the shops that share that tile's row or column. Three times the board is filled with tiles and shop money is earned, after which the player with the most money wins.

In Kingdoms, the English-language version of Auf Heller und Pfennig, players try to collect the most gold by establishing castles in the richest regions of the realm while avoiding hazards like dragons, swamps, and trolls. The 2011 edition includes detailed plastic castles, a streamlined rulebook, and the addition of a wizard tile—one that increases the rank of adjacent castles, multiplying their scores—previously available only at game conventions.

NAME: Hoity Toity
DESCRIPTION:
What do bored English noblemen do with their free time?  Well, according to this Spiel des Jahres (1990) winner by Klaus Teuber, they like collecting old junk and then showing it off.  Players buy or steal various pieces of junk in the form of cards, trying to form the largest and oldest collection.  Built on a 'rock-paper-scissors' mechanism, this game gives all players a couple of choices each turn.  The trick is in guessing what your opponents are likely to do, and planning your choice accordingly -- only after everyone's decision is revealed do you know for certain whether you made the right one.

Note: Hoity Toity (Uberplay, 2004) is for 3 to 6 players.
      Spionage! (G&RRR, 1992) is for 2 to 5 players

NAME: Dune
DESCRIPTION:
Set thousands of years in the future, Dune the boardgame is based on the Frank Herbert novels about an arid planet at the heart of the human space empire's political machinations.

Designed by the creators at Eon of Cosmic Encounter fame, some contend that the game can best be described as Cosmic Encounter set within the Dune universe, but the two games bear little in common in the actual mechanics or goals; they're just both set in space.  Like Cosmic Encounter, it is a game that generates a lot of player interaction through negotiation and bluffing, but that can be said of numerous unrelated games.

Players each take the role of one of the factions attempting to control Dune.  Each faction has special powers that overlook certain rules in the game.  Each turn players move about the map attempting to pick up valuable spice while dealing with giant sandworms, deadly storms, and other players' military forces.  A delicate political balance is formed amongst the factions to prevent any one side from becoming too strong.  When a challenge is made in a territory, combat takes the form of hidden bids with additional treachery cards to further the uncertainty.

The game concludes when one faction (or two allied factions) is able to control a certain number of strongholds on the planet.

DESCRIPTION:
In an interesting departure from his normally computational-heavy game structure, Reiner Knizia put together this negotiation game.  Players are represented on the board by a group of politicians moving through a network of committees, and need to seek support from their competitors to advance upward toward the Senate.  Supporting an opponent gains you prestige, needed in quantity at the end of the game.  Once all five Senate positions are filled, the game is over, and only players who have a politician in the Senate are eligible to win.  Of those players, whoever has the most prestige wins.

The Primordial Soup is supposedly where all life came from.  Players take charge of a tribe of amoeba as they struggle to survive.  In order to help their quest, tribes will take various genetic advantages, which allow them to 'break' the rules of life.  For instance, instead of going hungry, your amoeba could learn to attack foreign amoeba for food.  Or perhaps your amoeba could be taught to need less food to survive.  Either way, this is a very interesting take on the game of life.

NAME: The Really Nasty Horse Racing Game
DESCRIPTION:
The world of horseracing has long been associated with cheating in all its forms.  But few games ever attempt to simulate that aspect.  Players are assigned a horse and must move it around the track by rolling a single die.  This would be rather boring if the game didn't allow for the players to bet on another player's horse, so the dilemma is whether to move your horse badly just to make it easier for the horse you bet on to win.  Even that could be boring, but then each player is issued cards which allow them to commit dirty tricks, for instance making a horse fall or forcing the winner to take a drug test.  All in all, it makes for some very interesting racing.

NAME: Take it Easy!
DESCRIPTION:
It's really difficult to succinctly describe this game, so take a look at the pictures! Take It Easy is a true multi-player solitaire in which each player individually completes a hexagon-shaped board with spots for 19 hexagon tiles. There's no limit to number of players if you've got enough sets on hand. One person (the caller) draws a tile randomly and tells the others which of the 27 tiles featuring colored/numbered lines crossing in three directions, with numbers from 1 to 9, it is. "The 9-8-7," for example. Each player then chooses which empty spot on his own board he'll play the 9-8-7. This is repeated until the boards are filled.

The idea is to complete same-numbered lines across your board. Scoring is calculated by multiplying the number on the tile with the number of tiles in the completed line. A complete column of three 9s is worth 27, for example...but a lot of players will hope for five 9s to fill the big column down the middle.

Take It Easy is often compared to Bingo because of the familiar pattern of a number being called and then everybody looking at their cards to play it, and then scoring if a line is completed. But that's as far as the comparison goes.  Bingo is sheer luck; Take It Easy is a game of skill.

NAME: Iron Dragon
DESCRIPTION:
From the box: "Iron Dragon™ takes railroading games where they have never gone before -- to a land filled with elves, cat-people, trolls and magic. Genetically engineered dragons pull trains across dangerous and unexplored territory. Connect cities, fight off forest creatures, and explore the underground to build a railroad empire.

Based on the Empire Builder® system, this fantasy game puts classic building strategy and money management tools in a new venue. Players use erasable crayons on a special board and operate a rail empire. Perfect for an evening of fun and adventure with family and friends."

In Iron Dragon, probably the most elaborate of the crayon rail games from Mayfair Games, players are set within a fantasy world attempting to create an extensive and profitable rail network.  Players use crayons to draw their rail lines on the game board itself and use their existing rail lines to pick up and deliver commodities for payouts dictated by cards.

In addition to the standard mechanics of Empire Builder, Iron Dragon introduces Foremen, which reduce terrain building/river crossing costs depending on their race (elves get a discount in the forest, dwarves get a discount in the mountains, etc.) and Ships, which allow trains to cross the sea between continents, avoid bottlenecks on land, or jump between two unconnected rail networks. Resources are much more segregated by region, with each region specializing in a few resources based on their back story (which is written in the manual).

NAME: Caesar & Cleopatra
DESCRIPTION:
Caesar and Cleopatra is a two player card laying game where players assume the roles of these two great leaders. Caesar wants Rome to invade Egypt while Cleopatra wants it to remain independant and both try to influence Roman officials to support their cause.

Players take turns and send their agents, i.e. play numbered cards from 1 to 5 to influence one group of Roman officials, Aedils, Quaestors, Senators, Pretorians and Censors. They can send fewer agents face-down or more agents face-up. Additionally they can play action cards like Assassins that take out opposing agents or scouts that reveal face-down agents. Players can decide if they want to refill their hand from the agent deck or the action card deck but once one of the decks is empty they don't have access to anymore of these cards.

After each players turn, a card from the voting stack is revealed and the group of officials that is indicated on the card casts their vote. The player who has the most influence points next to that group wins one official from that group to his cause and then removes his strongest agent from that stack.

The game ends when all the officials have picked a side and the player who has influenced most of them wins the game, with bonus points for the majority in each group and some simple hidden objectives.

During the game you expand by playing Land and Water cards in the large area of the harbor. By the end of the game points are awarded according to ownership of the largest commodity majorities in each harbor area.

This game has many optional rules, scenarios, expansions and variations.  The game is intended to be played by the advanced rules.

While creative spelling of the words in question can be frowned upon, it's up to the guy next to you to determine your fate.

The basic idea in Hoax is to pretend to be somebody you are not while working towards the goal of figuring out who other people are. Each player is assigned one of six different characters -- each with its own unique abilities -- but can pretend to be any character and use its corresponding powers.  Abilities are used to acquire 3 different types of goods, which can be spent to get clues to opponents' identities.  If the majority of the other players think you're pretending to be a character that you're not, you must either admit that you are not that character (and permanently lose the use of its power), or reveal that you are and win the game.

NAME: Pit
DESCRIPTION:
The original game was invented by Harry E. Gavitt and published in 1903 by Gavitt Publishing and Printing.  In that game players deal and trade cards to corner the railway stock market. Be the first to get all the cards of one railway line, call out “Topeka” and you’ll win the hand!

But Pit, the more famous version, adapted by noted psychic Edgar Cayce, was first published by Parker Brothers in 1904 and in many editions since. In this loud, real-time trading game, players are given the task of cornering the market in one type of commodity.  There are as many suits as there are players, and all the cards are dealt out at the start of each round.  When the trading begins, players offer sets of cards to each other in the hopes of completing a set for themselves.  If you're successful, you ring the (optional)bell and yell out, "Corner on wheat!" (or whatever your commodity is). You then score points depending on which it was - some are more valuable than others. Two cards labeled Bull and Bear may be used to add wild/penalty cards to the gameplay.

Most editions support up to 8 players, but at least one allows up to 10.

NAME: Andromeda
DESCRIPTION:
Each player controls bases/stations (in the form of little wooden cubes) which they use to attempt to build Economic Centers on the moons of seven planets in an alien planetary system.  After moving their tokens on to a planet, players use an interesting little device ('planet ring'/'wormhole' - functions like a blind draw bag) to select one of the tokens on the planet.  Players take actions by collecting sets of cards which correspond to the the various planets.  The game also features a unique trading system which facilitates the card collecting. Careful card trading and calculating risk of establishing economic centers, and some variants, mitigate some of the luck factor.



Game Summary
Setup: 9 cards/player. Place 1 cube per planet per player, plus additional cube per planet matching cards dealt out; remaining cubes on earth. Each gets 2 special action cards.Each round: First, players may play a single special action card, in order. Then, Trade Step. Finally, Action Step.

Trade Step: Start player first plays cards (2-3) to offer, one at a time; other players simultaneously show cards to trade, different than offered. Start player must trade; recipient either accepts cards into hand, or leaves out. Clockwise from Start Player, next player with cards still in front of them either makes a trade or takes their cards back. Continue till 0-1 people left with cards in front; they take them back to hand.

Action Step: Start player takes 3 actions, then others take 2 each. Actions can be:
- discard 2 cards, then draw 2
- turn in set of 3-7 cards to send half (rounding down) as many cubes from earth to a planet
- turn in set of 3-7 cards to advance Ship Level, Tech Level, or to make attempt to establish colony on a planet matching cards played: place cubes on that planet into the cosmic ashtray, randomize, then reveal up to as many cubes as attempts made. If reveal your cube, place it on a station; turn over. If other player's cube, send it back to earth.
- Sets: if no wilds ("pure"), take appropriate bonus wild card matching the size of the set (if available); wilds can be used later as parts of sets

Then rotate starting player to the left. Game ends when all stations on 3 planets have been taken. Score VP shown on board (for Tech level, stations occupied, and cubes on earth). Most VP wins.

DESCRIPTION:
Players compete with each other to own vineyards in Italy.  Each vineyard may be used to grow certain types of grapes, and players make money by selling grapes on the open market.  Through careful manipulation of the market and the domination of vineyards in each province, the player with the most vineyards wins the game.

NAME: Wortelboer
DESCRIPTION:
In this very unusual card game, players are given equal stacks of cards, which have either carrots, bunnies, or foxes pictured on them.  The idea is that players set the cards out in biological pyramids, with the carrots eaten by the bunnies and the bunnies eaten by the foxes.  However, there is nothing simple about this intriguing and mystifying little game.

DESCRIPTION:
This game is from Alan Moon's days at White Wind.  Sharing many elements with Avalon Hill's Kremlin, players represent a family of wizards that are seeking to advance their political power.  Players are given an armada of dice to roll for a turn, and these are then used to lend points of support for upcoming elections.  The winner is the player who either takes the top office twice or gathers the most political points over the course of four turns.

DESCRIPTION:
One of game designer Sid Sackson's greatest contributions to the negotiation genre, this game has players  trying to construct the best buildings in a rapidly growing city.  The map is a collection of city blocks broken into smaller properties.  Each turn, players choose one property and try to work out deal for placing a new structure on the board.  The value of each building is determined by the type of buildings in the same block, so both a school and an apartment building receive bonuses for existing together.

NAME: Buy Low Sell High
DESCRIPTION:
Another of Reiner Knizia's fleet of games, this one is about making profits by buying and selling business stock. Players use cards to manipulate the price of three types of stocks (oil, technology, and retail), and the buying and selling of the stocks is pretty severely limited. Short and sweet, this game is both elegant and abstract.  In a change from the original version, the three stocks have different levels of volatility.  Technology is the most volatile, oil is the least volatile but with higher dividends, and retail falls in the middle.

The original version of this game, Palmyra, was based around three trade routes which were represented by wooden amphoras.

NAME: Crude: The Oil Game
DESCRIPTION:
In Crude: The Oil Game, players take on the role of oil company CEOs, seeking to expand their companies into multi-national energy mega-corporations.  Just as with real world energy companies, player will setup facilities for oil drilling, oil pumping, oil refining into gasoline, and gasoline selling to the consumer... all of which are represented by actual plastic pieces placed on the board!  Players also speculate by buying and selling oil and gasoline barrels in both the domestic and foreign markets... again represented by actual plastic barrels in their playing area!

However, the changing economic climate, as well as sudden world news events, will challenge players to keep a long-term strategic view of the world energy markets.  The first player to reach a corporation value of $750 million is the winner!

Crude: The Oil Game is not only a great simulation of the global oil markets, but with almost 300 plastic playing pieces, it is a sight to behold!  Known as McMulti when it was printed in Europe almost 25 years ago, this great game is finally back in print after many years!

Brought back into print in 2012 by Stronghold Games, Crude: The Oil Game has been a highly sought-after ("Grail") game. This is an early Euro-style game – before Euro-style existed! – which accurately simulates the market forces and elements of the oil and gasoline markets at all levels of production, including oil drilling, oil pumping, oil and gasoline buying and selling in the domestic and foreign markets, oil refining, and finally gasoline selling to the consumer.

DESCRIPTION:
Translated as Soldier of Fortune, this game features players trying to construct a castle.  Each turn, players secretly select two actions from a possible six.  If a player is the only one to pick a particular action, then the action gives more benefits.  Otherwise, players pick certain actions to earn money, build pieces of their castle, steal from other players, or receive special action cards.

NAME: PitchCar
DESCRIPTION:
This game entry refers to two nearly identical games which are not compatible with one another. Ages 6 and up.

PitchCar and Carabande are dexterity games where large, wooden, puzzle-like pieces are used to construct a race track that looks very similar to a slot car track when finished.  But instead of using electrons, players use finger-flicks to send small pucks around the track, a la Carrom.

Contents:

     Eight car discs
     One black "spacer" disc
     Six straightaways 
     Ten 90-degree curves 
     Rail pieces for straights and curves
     One Start/Finish line sticker
     One rule sheet with suggested track layouts
     One score pad







    
         Carabande was produced by Goldsieber and had only the single expansion with the Action Set.  Both are currently out of print.  It was also produced in a special "Audi" edition, titled Rennspiel-Action. In the BGG photo gallery, Carabande has yellow/orange rails.Expanded by:

    Carabande Action Set





         PitchCar is produced by Ferti.  It currently has five expansions which add "tight" curves, crossroads, small jumps, long straightaways, 45-degree curves, and curved bottlenecks.  PitchCar apparently also has two editions, where the first edition has the black laminate on the top and bottom of the track pieces, where the second edition only has the laminate on the top of the track pieces.   In the BGG photo gallery, PitchCar has red rails.Expanded by:

NAME: Piratenbillard
DESCRIPTION:
This interesting dexterity game is played on a table-like board that is a wooden lattice with a piece of linen stretched over the bottom.  Little colored balls are placed in the resulting holes, and then players use long wooden mallets to strike the bottom of the table.  When a ball is hit correctly, it will pop out of the space it's in and land in another space closer to the opposite side of the board.  Landing on another player's ball lets you capture it, but if your ball lands off the board, it's out of the game.

NAME: Mü & More
DESCRIPTION:
While the headline game, Mü, is the main attraction, this deck of custom cards comes with rules for several games:

    Mü - A complex trick-taking game. For 3-6 players, ages 12 and up.
    The Last Panther - A trick-taking game similar to Hearts, where players try to avoid negative points. For 3-8 players, ages 10 and up.
    Wimmüln - A trick-taking game where players must estimate how many tricks they will take, akin to Oh Hell!. For 3-6 players, ages 8 and up.
    Rummü - A Rummy-like card laying game where players try to get rid of their hands by playing high-scoring combinations of cards. For 3-6 players, ages 8 and up.
    Safarü - A card "catching" game using basic adding skills. For 2-4 players, ages 10 and up.
    Calcory (only in the original 1995-1998 edition) - A memory and calculation game, where players push their luck to uncover the most cards. For 2-4 players, ages 7 and up. Calcory uses wooden markers that were not packaged in subsequent releases, so the game was dropped from the set.




Mü is regarded by many as one of the best offerings in the trick-taking genre.  Players reveal cards to declare their bids: the highest bidder becomes the Chief and the second highest bidder is the Vice.  Both the Vice and Chief choose a trump (either number or suit), and then players try to capture tricks to score the most points.  The Chief chooses a partner and tries to cover the bid to score bonus points, while the Vice and remaining players seek to stop the Chief from reaching his goal.

The deck consists of 60 cards in 5 different colored suits.  Each suit contains cards numbered from 0 to 9, with two of each the 1 and 7 cards.  Cards also have 0, 1, or 2 triangles printed on them to show the point value of that card.

MÃ¼ & Lots More includes a a tweaked version of Mü and a different set of games.

NAME: Take 5!
DESCRIPTION:
Relying heavily on his previous effort, 6 Nimmt!, Wolfgang Kramer has transformed it into a more strategic game.  The deck is numbered from 1 to 98, with some of the cards having green bullheads and others having red bullheads.  In this game greens are positive points and reds are negative points.  As in 6 Nimmt!, players are constructing sets of cards, with the fifth card in a set taking the whole thing.  This time, however, players take their turns sequentially and can play one to three cards from their hands.

In a confusing twist, the Dutch edition of 6 Nimmt! is called Take 5! but is the progenitor game, not this game.

The Dutch version has 104 cards, can play up to 10 people. Players pick one of their 10 starting cards, once everybody has chosen a card all players flip it. The lowest number goes first and add it to one of the 4 numbers on the table (always needs to be a higher number, always 1 row fits). If you lay the 6th card on one of the 4 rows in the middle of the table you have to take all 5 cards of that row. The 6th one then becomes the starting number of that row. You repeat this until one player manages to lose all his cards. All cards have a number of cows on it. Every black cow is 1 point. Every red cow is 5 points. The goal is to lose all your cards and get as little points as possible. You play this over multiple rounds to declare a winner.

Players use cards to generate rail, trains, commodity production, demand for commodities, bank failures, labor strikes, derailments and all kinds of other period flavor.  This richly themed game takes several hours to complete.

NAME: Was sticht?
DESCRIPTION:
This is a two-trump, trick-taking card game, with several twists.  At the beginning of the game, players draft tasks they intend to complete in order to win the game.  (Tasks include things like "Take no tricks", "Take 1 Trick", or "Take No Red Cards".)  Then, all of the cards are dealt out in front of the players before each hand.  Row by row, the players draft cards, and the dealer declares who would have won each row's trick, if it had been played that way.  Players use this information to deduce what the trump number and suit are.  After all the cards are drafted, each player - except the dealer - selects one of the task tiles she drafted, which will be her mission for the hand.  The dealer is stuck trying to uniquely accomplish someone else's task for the round - but at least doesn't have to preselect which person's goal he is trying to "steal".  The hand is then played in the traditional fashion, with each player trying to take tricks or not, based on the goal she selected.  The first player to complete five tasks wins the game.

Eurorails is another entry in the Mayfair Games crayon rail games, like Empire Builder and India Rails.  Its puzzle-piece board forms a map of Europe broken down into dots.  Players use different-colored crayons to draw rail from dot to dot, building their rail system.  A large deck of cards is used to determine how much money will be generated by picking up a particular commodity and delivering it to the listed city, with the payoffs being related to how far away the source is from the destination.  As players generate more money, they build successively larger and more comprehensive rail systems, hopefully connecting to almost all the major cities.  The goal of the game is to generate a set amount of money once you've linked all the major cities.

NAME: The Awful Green Things From Outer Space
DESCRIPTION:
The Eighth Edition is finely produced with thick cardboard counters and a sturdy thick game board. The rules are in full color (with cartoon) and very well done. This humorously entertaining game pits two players against each other aboard a spaceship.  One plays the ship's crew, trying to kill the evil and rapidly-multiplying aliens controlled by his opponent.  And although the crew members have several weapons available to them, they don't know what effect those weapons will have until they try using them in combat against the Awful Green Things. Originally appeared in the Dragon magazine #28.  The Outside the Znutar expansion, published in Dragon magazine #40, is included in the box in the Steve Jackson Games versions of the game.

A similar but more serious game is The Wreck of the B.S.M. Pandora.

Supplemental articles were published in TSR's Dragon Magazine including:

DESCRIPTION:
A clever repackaging of the parlor game Dictionary, Balderdash contains several cards with real words nobody has heard of.  After one of those words has been read aloud, players try to come up with definitions that at least sound plausible, because points are later awarded for every opposing player who guessed that your definition was the correct one.

Versions of the game as a parlor game go back at least as far as 1970, although Balderdash itself was not published until 1984.

Mattel republished Balderdash in 2006 in a form that derives its gameplay from the sequel Beyond Balderdash.

    In a peculiar situation, this game was reimplemented by Beyond/Absolute Balderdash and then combined back into the original title (Balderdash) but with the rules and cards from Beyond/Absolute; while Tactic re-published their version of Beyond/Absolute combined with the original Balderdash and called it Kokkelimonke Jubileum.

NAME: James Ernest's Totally Renamed Spy Game
DESCRIPTION:
Before I Kill You, Mr. Bond is a silly, stupid game straight from the Cheapass Games playbook. In it, players take on the role of villains building their remote fortresses and capturing secret agents. When one is captured, he can be killed right away, but what's the fun in that? The real points come when you slowly reveal your secret plan to him, or leave him to be eaten by sharks. Of course, that's where the risk is too, and the longer you postpone the kill, the greater the likelihood that another player will produce a card that allows the agent to escape and destroy your fortress.

Reissued in color in 2004 as James Ernest's Totally Renamed Spy Game (with alot more cards).

NAME: Empire Builder
DESCRIPTION:
Epic Railroad Building in North America

Discover a modern North American classic.  Celebrate one of our most vital and enduring passions: railroads.  Use your initial investment to build track.  Then pick up commodities where they are grown, mined, or manufactured and deliver them to a lucrative place of demand.  Complete a delivery and make the money you need to buy larger, faster trains, and expand your railroad empire.  Win the game by building the most effective railroad empire!

The original and flagship of Mayfair's crayon-rails line allows players, using washable crayons, to draw their train routes over a map of North America.  Players start with an initial sum of money which they use to build short lengths of track during their first couple of turns.  For the rest of the game, players operate their trains over the track network drawn on the board to pick up and deliver loads to various cities, and then have the opportunity to add to their track network or improve their train.  The game uses demand cards which list three demands, each of a commodity to be delivered to a specified city for a given payoff.  Each player has three demand cards to provide opportunities for income.

Each turn consists of an operations phase and a building phase.  During the operations phase, trains are moved to cities where commodities are picked up at no cost and moved to one of the cities on that player's demand cards.  When the commodity is delivered, the player receives the payoff and trades that demand card for a new one.  Event cards are mixed in the deck with the demand cards.  When an event card is drawn the instructions are followed.  During the building phase a player may pay to build more track or upgrade his train.

A player wins by being the first to connect his track network to six of the seven major cities on the board and acquire $250,000,000 in cash on hand.

Experience the thrill of fencing— board game style! In this two-player game, tactics, skill, and a little bit of luck will determine the best fencer.  Teach yourselves the concepts with the basic game, test yourselves with the standard game, and challenge yourselves with the advanced game. Cards fly back and forth as the fencers attack, and parry-riposte.

Who will be bold enough to attack first?  Is it possible to win with that initial attack or has your opponent beguiled you into an attack while waiting to mount a parry-riposte?

En Garde is a very dynamic game— strategically rich yet easy to learn and play.  Three levels of rules are included in the game.

NAME: Family Business
DESCRIPTION:
Family Business takes mob warfare to a new level of backstabbing, revenge, and general bloodthirstiness, which is what makes it such a blast to play.  Every player controls a 'family' and plays various cards to off other players' family members.  In a game with this little structure, it's possible for everyone to gang up on one unlucky soul, or for the damage to be fairly evenly spread.  Either way, the last family standing is victorious.

Each player starts with a gang of nine characters. To try to get rid of other gangsters, contracts are played on them. If these contracts are not blocked by anyone, the targeted gangster is placed on the hitlist. As soon as six gangsters are on the hitlist a mobwar is started. This means that, at the start of every turn, the first character on this list is eliminated. This goes on until the list is empty.
Mobwars can also be triggered by cards being played. When no more than the last six or fewer characters are in play a constant mobwar is going on, until only one player has characters left.

In general players take turns clockwise, however, the turn goes to any player who plays a response card and then clockwise mode is resumed with the player next to him/her. Lots of interaction as players play cards to put gangsters on the list, save them, have them replaced, start a Mob War, or stop it...

NAME: Chess
DESCRIPTION:
Chess is a two-player, abstract strategy board game that represents medieval warfare on an 8x8 board with alternating light and dark squares. Opposing pieces, traditionally designated White and Black, are initially lined up on either side. Each type of piece has a unique form of movement and capturing occurs when a piece, via its movement, occupies the square of an opposing piece. Players take turns moving one of their pieces in an attempt to capture, attack, defend, or develop their positions. Chess games can end in checkmate, resignation, or one of several types of draws. Chess is one of the most popular games in the world, played by millions of people worldwide at home, in clubs, online, by correspondence, and in tournaments. Between two highly skilled players, chess can be a beautiful thing to watch, and a game can provide great entertainment even for novices. There is also a large literature of books and periodicals about chess, typicially featuring games and commentary by chess masters.

The current form of the game emerged in Southern Europe during the second half of the 15th century after evolving from a similar, much older game of Indian origin. The tradition of organized competitive chess began in the 16th century. The first official World Chess Champion, Wilhelm Steinitz, claimed his title in 1886. The current World Champion is Magnus Carlsen, Norway. Chess is also a recognized sport of the International Olympic Committee.

NAME: For Sale
DESCRIPTION:
For Sale is a quick, fun game nominally about buying and selling real estate. During the game's two distinct phases, players first bid for several buildings then, after all buildings have been bought, sell the buildings for the greatest profit possible.

The original Ravensburger/FX Schmid edition (1997/98) has slightly different rules than later English editions, and only 20 buildings instead of 30.
 The Ãœberplay 2005 Edition has new art, rules and card distribution changes, and it accommodates 3-6 players.

The Gryphon 2009 Edition uses the Überplay art for the faces of the property cards, while replacing most other art.  The rules are the same as the Überplay edition, with the exception of the rounding rule (which was stated in different ways in different printings of the Überplay edition).

Rounding rule

The rounding rule preferred by the designer Stefan Dorra is that players get back half of their bid rounded DOWN (not UP), as confirmed in correspondence with him here and here.  A history of how the rounding rule has changed in different editions is documented here.

NAME: Formula Dé
DESCRIPTION:
Formula Dé is a fast-paced racing game in which the cars' top speeds are limited by having to end a certain number of turns in each curve of the racetrack.  This can be tricky, because although players can regulate their speeds by choosing which gear to be in and each gear allows a certain range of movement, the exact amount is determined randomly.   Great fun for a big group.

The base game comes with:

     One set of dice (special d30, d20, d12, d8, d6, d4 and a normal black d20)
     Ten plastic cars (with interchangeable rear spoilers)
     One two-sided map Formula DÃ© Circuits 1 & 2: Monaco & Zandvoort 1

     Racing sheets (for 1, 2 and 3-lap races)

NAME: T-Rex
DESCRIPTION:
Many regard this game as a trick-taking game, however that would be a very liberal interpretation of trick-taking.  Players are each given an equal set of cards, which they randomly pick a hand of seven.  Each hand one suit is a trump suit, and one suit is a non-trump suit.  Players place one of their cards in front of themselves, and this continues until the hand ends.  At that time, the top card on their piles are compared and the best card picks his reward first, and the remaining reward going to the second place.  The reward cards give players points, and the highest total at the end of the game wins.

NAME: Raj
DESCRIPTION:
Rarely is a game broken down to its barest elements like this one (one of the others being For Sale).  Raj was originally printed as Hol's der Geier. Its main 'simultaneous action' mechanism has been used numerous times: most recently as Sky Runner, or Olympia 2000 (v. Chr.), or even For Sale to a certain extent.  Players are given an equal deck of cards from one to fifteen.  Each turn, a prize tile is randomly selected from a pool.  The prize tile either has positive or negative points, and each player is attempting to gather the most positive points from these prizes.  Players secretly select one of their remaining fifteen cards, and reveal them simultaneously.  The highest card gets the prize (if positive), or the lowest card get the prize (if negative).  However, if two people play the highest (or lowest) card, they cancel each other out and the prize goes to the next in line...

DESCRIPTION:
Working in fast-food is hell.  All the employees are zombies, and you can't find a single brain amongst them.  Except for the brain part - there is, in fact, one brain - that's the premise of Give Me the Brain!, a card game in which players take on the roles of zombies in a fast-food restaurant in hell.  They all have to complete a number of tasks before leaving work, and the work keeps piling on.  Even worse, some of the tasks require basic intelligence and there's only one brain to go around.

NAME: Mole Hill
DESCRIPTION:
In this strange little game, players take the roles of a gardener protecting his lawn and a mole digging it up.  The gardener must try to block the mole's moves and fence him in quickly, while the mole must dig as many holes as possible before being caught.

Essentially, the mole may move any direction, horizontally or diagonally from square to square, while the gardener places boundary sticks down along the edges of the square, which the mole may not cross.  The mole and gardener may either move or place down a boundary stick, and move alternately.  Eventually, the gardener will hem the mole in completely and the round is over.  In addition, if the mole can move into flower beds, extra points are scored.  By moving to the center, the mole may also tunnel deeply to any selected square on the board, thus escaping the (by then) rapidly closing trap of boundary sticks.  Depending on how many moves this took, more or less points are earned by the mole.

Once points are totaled up, the roles are reversed and another round is played.  The winner is the player who scored the most points as the mole.

NAME: Nuba
DESCRIPTION:
The board is a 5 x 6 grid. Each player has ten tokens, numbered 1 - 9 and one 'X'. Players alternate setting their pieces in the two rows nearest them. The lower the number on the token, the better a wrestler that piece is. The higher the number, the better the musician (but that makes that piece a lousy wrestler). The idea is to get your highest possible piece to the opposite side of the board.

When a piece successfully reaches the opposite side of the board, it is placed in the honorable musician space. It remains there unless another piece (of either player) with a higher value reaches the opposite side, in which case it supplants this piece as the best musician. The game ends when no one can oust the reigning musician (which means no one has a piece left on the board of a higher value). If a player's piece marked with the 'X' reaches the opposite side, the game immediately ends and that player is victorious.

DESCRIPTION:
The setting is pool side at a swanky hotel and players are trying to get their beach towels into the choice locations next to the pool.  Players use equal sets of power cards to determine the number of placement points for each round.  These movement points are then used to place their towels or dislodge others' towels.  However activity in a particular row of towels attracts the attention of the cabana boys, who can eventually lock a row up permanently.

DESCRIPTION:
Possibly the most popular, mass market war game.  The goal is conquest of the world.

Each player's turn consists of:
- gaining reinforcements through number of territories held, control of every territory on each continent, and turning sets of bonus cards.
-  Attacking other players using a simple combat rule of comparing the highest dice rolled for each side.  Players may attack as often as desired.  If one enemy territory is successfully taken, the player is awarded with a  bonus card.
-  Moving a group of armies to another adjacent territory.

NAME: Knights of Charlemagne
DESCRIPTION:
In this quick, fun, and fairly abstract game, players play cards in an effort to acquire tiles that are either color-coded or number-coded.  Players take turns, first playing a card onto a tile that matches either the card's number or its color, then drawing to refill their hands.  When all cards have been played, each tile is evaluated, and whichever player has the most cards played to that tile gets that tile's points.  After calculating point totals and figuring in bonuses, the player with the highest score is the winner.

NAME: Stonehenge
DESCRIPTION:
The Megalith edition is Selection #9 of The Games Collection by Pin International.

This two player game has druids competing at Stonehenge to be the Master Druid. Each player has 8 coloured megaliths (just tall blocks) and 9 matching discs, numbered 1,1,2,2,3,3,4,5 & 6. The board is a triangle of 5 dissecting lines, with the corners lopped off,so the lines are 2,3,4,5,4 spaces long. On each side are 5 extra spaces, where players put their megaliths. First to get their 8th megalith down, wins.

Players take turns to put a numbered disc on the intersections of the lines. When you have the majority total in any direction, you claim that line by placing your megalith on the end point. Ties on a line are lost by the last placing player, a clever balancing rule which forces careful choices.

Stonehenge is a same game as Linea (Spielbox 1992, smaller board).

DESCRIPTION:
In this wacky Cheapass title, players are Sous Chefs trying to get to the top floor of a skyscraper by scaling the outside.  However the maniacal Devil Bunny is hopping about in a mad lust for blood thinking he'll get a ham by knocking you off.  Yeah, right, whatever.  Players seek to move their two markers along a wide-ish track.  The trick is that your pieces can only move diagonally, and your movement points are somewhat dictated by dice.  Plus, when you roll a certain number, the Devil Bunny lands on the leading player, which knocks him off the building and perhaps into the person below him.  Oh my.

NAME: Split
DESCRIPTION:
Newer version of SPLIT is now available. Publisher is GDC-GameDevCo Ltd. The game still features the patented SPLIT half cards and looks much better than the original (design wise) and seems to have some adjustments to the rules.

In this surprisingly solid offering from Hasbro, players use cards to take actions on a board.  The cards depict halves of a standard deck of cards, and players attempt to match the halves with those next to the board.  Depending on the quality of the match (perfect, strong, weak), the action is likewise powerful or weak.  The object of the game is to place a series of your markers in a continuous line across the board.  Also the game is scalable for two to six players, with four through six using partners to keep the action interesting.

NAME: Go
DESCRIPTION:
By all appearances, it's just two players taking turns laying stones on a 19×19 (or smaller) grid of intersections.  But once its basic rules are understood, Go shows its staggering depth. One can see why many people say it's one of the most elegant brain-burning abstract games in history, with players trying to claim territory by walling off sections of the board and surrounding each other's stones.  The game doesn't end until the board fills up, or, more often, when both players agree to end it, at which time whoever controls the most territory wins.

The earliest mention of Go (åœæ£‹ (wéi qí)- "surrounding game") appears in the "Analects" of Confucius (551-479 BC), while the earliest physical evidence is a 17×17 Go board discovered in 1952 in a tomb of the former Han dynasty (206 BC- 9 AD). There is a tangle of conflicting popular and scholarly anecdotes attributing its invention to two Chinese emperors, an imperial vassal and court astrologers. One story has it that Go was invented by the legendary Emperor Yao (ruled 2357-2256 BC) as an amusement for his idiot son. A second claims that the Emperor Shun (ruled 2255-2205 BC) created the game in hopes of improving his weak-minded son's mental prowess. A third says the person named Wu, a vassal of the Emperor Jie (ruled 1818-1766 BC), invented Go (as well as games of cards). Finally, a fourth story suggests that Go was developed by court astrologers during the Zhou dynasty (1045-255 BC).

A Go set, consisting of a very general-purpose grid and colored stones, can also be used to play a variety of other abstract strategy games, such as  Connect6, Go-Moku, Pente, and others.

NAME: Die Siedler von Nürnberg
DESCRIPTION:
Based on the well-known Settlers of Catan, this stand-alone game published in commemoration of the anniversary of the founding of the city of Nürnberg gives players some new twists to the familiar experience.  Unlike standard Settlers, the game layout is not modular.  Instead the board features a split map, half of which has the goods-producing hexes of a conventional Settlers game where settlements will be built and the other half showing a closeup of Nürnberg where "workshops" will be built (in lieu of promoting settlements to cities as in the original Settlers).  The players also get currency for manufactured goods which in turn they spend on walls and towers to surround the city, which earn prestige points which ultimately count toward victory points.  Probably the most interesting other detail is that instead of rolling dice, a special deck of cards is used to reveal the production number -- and possibly an event -- at the beginning of each player's turn.

Belongs to the Catan Series.

DESCRIPTION:
Players are socialites who are trying to take as many high-value luxuries as they can manage.  A number of luxuries (boats, mansions, watches, boats, etc.) of values varying from one million to seven million are laid out in a matrix.  Players take turn placing power cards in the columns, and after five of the six cards have been played, the highest bid takes the first luxury in the column, the second highest gets the next one up, and so on.  However, if you collect a second luxury item you already own, then the newest one replaces the older one, which could mean exchanging a lavish seven million dollar car for a paltry one million dollar one!  After the specified number of rounds, the highest valued collection is deemed the best.

With its interesting trading mechanism, this game can be a little hard to grasp at first, but it's worth the effort.  A note to the wise: although this game shares a common theme of beans (Bohnen) with Bohnanza, that's about the only similarity.

DESCRIPTION:
Fill or Bust is all about rolling dice and pressing your luck. On your turn, roll the dice and set aside at least one die that scores you points. If you want, you can roll the remaining dice – but if none of those dice score for you, you lose all points accumulated that round! Your challenge is further complicated by a deck of cards that determines what goal you might be forced to shoot for during that turn. Some goal cards dangle the prospect of huge bonuses, while others slam the door on you, ending your turn before it starts.

Other than the deck of cards that push goals on players, Fill or Bust is similar to Farkle.

Players can also develop armies to attack other players' cities  Excellent fun for the beer-and-pretzels crowd.

DESCRIPTION:
It looks a bit like Daytona 500 with its oversized racetrack gameboard, but it's a much simpler game.  The main thing going on is that you roll the five dice on your turn and pick which three you want to play.  Each die has the five colors for the five cars in the race and one "checkered flag" side which means you draw a card.  The dice are numbered 1 to 5 (that is, each die has one of the five numbers), and the three you pick have to be played in order.  If you draw a card, it might instruct you to move a particular car, or the car in last place, or to spin a car out; or it might make you a "Sponsor" of a car, meaning you could get prize money for a car other than your main car.

NAME: Kremlin
DESCRIPTION:
A game of political intrigue set in the Soviet Politburo. The game consists of a large number of politician cards, some of which form the first politburo. Politicians have certain stats (preferred offices, for instance) and an age.

At the start of the game, the players secretly note influence on ten politicians, graded from 10 (most) to 1 (least). Gameplay is not clockwise, but happens from top to bottom in the politburo. Whatever action the politician in a certain office can take is done by the player who reveals the greatest influence on the politician in question. Actions include accusing other politicians of espionage (potentially exiling them to Siberia), pardoning them, reshuffling the politburo and others. But each action a politician takes lets him (or in one case, her) age by one or more years. Once a turn each politburo member must face a health roll which can result in sickness marker or even instant death (the older, the most likely). At the end of each turn, the reigning head of state must wave to the crowd at the October parade without collapsing (which gets harder the sicker the politician is). A politician who succeeds in this three times makes the player who controls him/her the winner.

The original Fata Morgana edition included rules requiring the players to hold funeral speeches for deceased party chairmen and drinking vodka with it, for instance. The later Avalon Hill edition scrapped these rules and gave the game a less satirical and more serious tone.

The Jolly Roger edition provides three different KREMLIN games in one box:

1: The 'original' with fictional politicians, set in a USSR where KGB investigations send those found guilty to Siberia. This version will have victory conditions based on the original Fata Morgana rules.

2: A version inspired by the Avalon Hill variant titled 'Revolution'. Set in the 1920s, it uses historical politicians as well as fictional politicians. It's a more violent game as those arrested by the KGB are shot and removed from the game

3: A new version, set in the modern USSR and Russia, an era of entrenched bureaucracy and alternatives for escaping KGB persecution. This version introduces the concept of "Going into Exile" to avoid Siberia. It also includes modern politicians from the 1960s onwards, whether it is Kosygin or Putin and Gorbachev.

DESCRIPTION:
Based on Dante's Inferno, HellRail: 2nd Perdition has players creating rail to deliver the souls of the damned to the appropriate circles of Hell.  The card mechanics are clever, as every card can become a load to be delivered, or be used to build rail, move trains, or draw more cards.  Additionally, upon arriving at each circle, players have the choice to call forth that circle's powers, possibly putting a serious crimp in their opponents' efforts.

DESCRIPTION:
In Buried Treasure, players compete to compile sets of colored cards by drawing from several common stacks.  Depending on what symbol is on a card, drawing it might let you take another from the stacks or even steal cards of the same color from one of your opponents.  At the end of the round, the majority holders of each color will gain points; the amount of points varies each round.

NAME: Manhattan
DESCRIPTION:
In Manhattan, players are constructing a skyline of skyscrapers over several districts, or city blocks, of Manhattan Island.  Ultimately, each player seeks to have built the tallest buildings in the most city blocks of the Island.

Each turn, players will play a card that illustrates which part of a city block they may place a "floor" on a building.  The placement card is unique for each player in that the section they may place in is relative to their seating at the table.  The player who has placed the top most floor controls that building.  Each round, scores are tallied based on control of each of the neighborhoods.

At the end of the game, the player who has scored the most points through area control and tallest buildings, wins.

Note: In the Finnish edition, the districts are named after six great cities of the world: Hong Kong, Sao Paulo, Cairo, Sydney, Frankfurt and Manhattan.

NAME: Entdecker
DESCRIPTION:
[Careful: there are two similar games with Entdecker in the title. Don't confuse Entdecker with Die Neuen Entdecker (also known as Entdecker: Exploring New Horizons), a different game. In short - if your Entdecker's board has a scout trail leading to native huts, it's not this Entdecker.]

Entdecker starts with a blank game board that represents an unexplored sea. Tiles are drawn and placed on squares on the board. As the tiles are placed islands develop on the board and players pay to place settlements, bases, or scouts on these islands in an effort to become the most powerful discoverer of all. Completed islands yield victory points to all who have invested in exploration on an island, but of course the most points go to the player who has established the strongest presence.

Re-implemented by:


     Die Neuen Entdecker or Entdecker: Exploring New Horizons



     In 2004, a smaller version of the Entdecker game was released, based on the online version available on the www.playcatan.de site.
         Oceania.
    



     In 2007, the game system was revamped in a new "Entdecker"-series of 3 titles (so far):
         Im Reich der Jadegottin (published 2007)
         Im Reich der WÃ¼stensohne (published 2008)
         Im Reich der Dämonen (not yet published)

NAME: The Rose King
DESCRIPTION:
Originally published as Texas by db-Spiele.

The battle between farmers and ranchers is fairly abstract. A single pawn travels on a square grid. Each player has a hand of cards face up. These each have a direction and a distance. The player can either draw a card and add it to his hand, or play a card. If he plays a card, then the pawn moves the appropriate distance to an empty square, and the player places one of his markers. Each player also has judge symbols that can each be used only once. The judge lets you move onto a previously placed opposition marker and reverse it. Players score points for each contiguous region equal to the square of the number of markers. If a player is not careful, such a move may be forced, as there is a maximum number of cards that a player may hold.

Contains rules for playing with 4 (in two partnerships of two players).

Later republished 1999 as Rosenkönig by Kosmos, as part of the two-player game series. The republication also included a re-theming of the game. The setting changed from Texas to England, and the factions changed from farmers and ranchers to the factions of the Plantagenet family from the Wars of the Roses (1455-1485) - the Lancaster (red rose) and the York (white rose) factions in a similarly abstracted fashion.

Rosenkönig is part of the Kosmos two-player series.

NAME: Targui
DESCRIPTION:
Conquer and occupy the valuable desert grounds. And also keep your home village! By tactically moving groups of camels through the different desert grounds and by using its specialties you can rule the desert. -- from the rulebook

Targui has a board made of large square tiles representing the different types of desert ground. These provide varying economic and strategic value, from 0-5, and with a salt mine in the center, random distribution (with a little tinkering) makes a varied map each game. Players have a village tile which they place on the outer edge, and start with some camels and money. Your turn simply consists of moving and buying camels, expanding your control of the land.

Targui has very simple mechanisms, and is in effect a simple rolling war game with obvious tactics. But the random turn order creates a wonderful world of rapidly shifting alliances, with players making and breaking promises within moments. The winner is not the one with most money or camels, but with the most economic value under their control.

The game plays nicely with 3 or 4 players. However, Targui is a long game. Eight rounds takes about three hours, so using the whole deck of 20 fortune cards makes for an over-long game. If you enjoy Risk or light wargaming, then you'll get a lot from Targui.

NAME: Skworms
DESCRIPTION:
"The Worms Crawl In, The Worms Crawl Up Game" 
The object of the game is to be the first to get all your worms up the skeleton's bones so they disappear into his skull.

The players divide the worms between themselves, the youngest starts and the oldest gets the brain (a bad thing). On your turn, you spin the spinner to find out what you're allowed to do; this can be: 
- hang one of your worms on the skull, 
- pull a worm out of the skull and give it to another player, 
- give a worm to the player with the brain, 
- give/take the brain and spin again, 
- feed 1 worm to the skeleton, or 
- feed 2 worms to the skeleton.

When feeding worms to the skeleton, you turn the crank and hope your worm(s) will crawl up into the skull--but there's a chance it'll fall right back out into your lap, possibly accompanied by other worms that got stuck during a previous player's turn.

NAME: Stephensons Rocket
DESCRIPTION:
Reiner Knizia expands his fleet of tile laying games with this game about colliding railroads in early 1800's England.  There are seven different rail companies that players can expand.  Each time you extend a rail, the other stockholders can veto your action, but it might cost them their shares.  When two companies' rail touch, the railways merge to become one.  The game is over when only one company remains or there are no rail tiles remaining, and the winner is the player who earned the most money over the course of the game.

Twitch is an insanely frantic game of reacting to new information.  When someone plays a card, you must quickly determine if it points to you (e.g., if the player to your right plays a card that says "left"), and if it does, throw the top card of your deck onto the pile.  If you're not quick enough, another player will call you out, and you'll have to take all the cards in the pile into your deck.  The first person to run her deck out wins.

NAME: Ex & Hopp
DESCRIPTION:
A quick and simple card game for 2-6 milk-drinking players. Each player places a color card down as their marker and the matching sets of cards numbered 1-12 in those colors make up the deck. The deck is shuffled and players get 4 cards, the remainder goes down as a draw deck. There is a set of small tiles in red and black for negative or positive points (red are 4,4,5,5,6,6, black are 2,3,3,4,4,4,5,5,5,6,6,6). These are shuffled face down and 4 turned up to start 4 rows.

On your turn, you can place a card against a row or try to swap a card with another player. If you want to swap, you simply offer a color for another color, mentioning no numbers. Swap with the player of your choice, but if nobody wants to swap, you've wasted your turn.

When you play a card to a row, you draw back so you have 4 cards. When the row is full, determined by the number on the tile, the player with the highest total in the cards has to take the tile, be it positive or negative. Usually your choices are obvious, but sometimes it is worth assisting another player to take a row, rather than waste a good card for you on a low or negative tile. If a row is tied between players, the cards are discarded and the tile stays for more cards.

The discard deck is shuffled over, taken tiles refreshed by new ones. The game ends when the tiles are all taken, deduct the negative from the positive to get your score.

This game was re-themed and expanded on with Relikt.

NAME: Don Pepe
DESCRIPTION:
In this twisted little game, players take control of a gang of mobsters that are dedicated to extorting money out of businesses and rubbing out the competing mobs in the process.  All of the gang members are placed around an oblong table, with some of the places indicating certain benefits.  If a place has a picture of a business, then the player makes money until the mobster is killed or moved.  If the place has a gun, then he can use it to shoot a mobster across the table.  If a place has a knife, then he can use it to stab someone seated next to him.  Plus, some of the mobsters have the ability to kill others all the time by carrying their own knives and guns.  The game ends when all the available money is taken, and the largest pile of cash takes the game.

NAME: Times to Remember
DESCRIPTION:
In Times to Remember, the players are trying to remember particular times. Is that clear enough? No? Okay, here are more details.

Players aren't trying to remember times from their own lives, but rather times from the shared experiences of humanity as a whole. Each player or team starts the game with a set of brackets or tokens (depending on the version of the game), and the first player to rid herself of brackets wins.

On a turn, all players are confronted with a trivia question, say, "When did the first Star Wars arrive in theaters?" Each player then uses one bracket to mark a particular year or series of years on her individual year chart. Once everyone has placed their answers, the questioner reveals the answer and everyone sees whether that year appears in the range they guessed. If so, they remove that bracket from the game; if not, they keep the bracket. No matter how much you might want to hedge your guesses, eventually you'll need to guess a year dead on, so plumb the depths of your memory and take your best shot!

NAME: Café International
DESCRIPTION:
This game revolves around the placement of multi-national customers in a restaurant. The board shows many different tables, each with four chairs around them. The tables are grouped by nation, so the Chinese like to sit with other Chinese. However, some of the chairs are on the border between two nations, so a person from either place could occupy the seat. To further complicate this odd tile game, each of the people is either male or female, and tables must be gender-balanced.  As the game progresses some tiles become unplayable...

NAME: Tichu
DESCRIPTION:
Tichu is a partnership climbing card game, and the object of play is to rid yourself of your hand, preferably while scoring points in the process.

The deck is a standard 52-card pack with four special cards added: dog, phoenix, dragon and Mah Jong (1). When it's your turn, you may either beat the current top card combination — single card, pair of cards, sequence of pairs, full house, etc. — or pass. If play passes all the way back to the player who laid the top cards, he wins the trick, clears the cards, and can lead the next one. The card led determines the only combination of cards that can be played on that trick, so if a single card is led, then only single cards are played; if a straight of seven cards is led, then only straights of seven cards can be played, etc.

The last player out in a round gives all the cards he won to the player who exited first, and the last player's unplayed cards are handed to the opposite team. Fives, tens and Kings are worth 5, 10 and 10 points, with each hand worth one hundred points without bonuses — but the bonuses are what drive the game. At the start of a round, each player can call "Tichu" prior to her playing any card. This indicates that she thinks that she can empty her hand first this round; if she does so, her team scores 100 points, and if not, it loses 100 points. Cards are dealt at the start of a round in a group of eight and a group of six; a player can call "Grand Tichu" after looking at only her first eight cards for a ±200 point bonus. If both players on a team exit a round prior to either player on the opposite team, then no points are scored for cards and the winning team earns 200 points (with Tichu/Grand Tichu bonuses and penalties being applied as normal).

The first team to 1,000 points wins.

NAME: Atlanteon
DESCRIPTION:
Original edition, titled Revolution, is set in French Revolution era Paris. Royalists and Jacobins fight for superiority in the 25 city districts, which are represented by the game board. The two players alternatively place one of their counters in order to control that space. When a player puts one of his number counters on the board, he projects influence onto the neighboring spaces in that row and column, and onto the space the counter itself is on. The amount of the influence corresponds to the number on the counter. Whoever controls all three of the buildings or controls eleven city districts has won the game.

Later reprinted as Atlanteon in which mighty undersea warriors fight to control the capital of the Sunken Kingdoms. One player controls the vicious Marauders, who are trying to capture the city, while the other player controls the heroic Guardians, who are trying to defend their home.

NAME: A la carte
DESCRIPTION:
In one of his sillier games, Karl-Heinz Schmiel casts the players as semi-psychotic cooks attempting to hone their culinary skills. Each player receives a miniature pan and a hotplate. Then each turn you can either attempt to turn up the heat, season your dish, or attempt to steal another cook's recipe in the making. Heating your hotplate is a random affair with a die, and could raise the heat on everyone's plate. Spicing the dish is heart of the game and done by up-ending small bottles filled with little colored wood pellets. When the pellets tumble out of the bottle (sometimes, if they do), the number of pellets can't exceed two, because over-spicing the dish ruins it and you have to throw it in the trash!

The 2009 version includes some changed rules, a new victory condition, additional recipes and some new mechanics in comparison to the 1989 version.

NAME: High-Bid
DESCRIPTION:
Players represent collectors attempting to gather sets of valuable properties and artifacts ... coins, antiques, miniatures, etc. These sets are worth handsome sums at game's end. Individual pieces of a set are worthless at game's end, but are able to be sold during the course of the game in order to provide a cash-flow.

These 'properties' are represented on cards. There are 12 different types of properties, varying from 3 - 6 pieces per set. Naturally, the sets containing six pieces are much more valuable than the sets containing only three pieces as it is much more difficult to complete these larger sets.

Each player is dealt six cards and given a starting 'fund' of $2,000. The top 'property' card is revealed and a bidding ensues. The winner pays the bank and takes the card into his hand. The player then has the option of selling 1 - 3 properties to the bank. The idea here is to rid yourself of properties that you do not wish to collect and provide a source of income.

There is danger, however. The sales price is determined randomly via the roll of two dice. The price can vary from 25% - 100% of the listed worth of the item. Further, if a '0' is rolled on one of the dice, then the item is NOT sold outright, but rather an auction takes place amongst the players. This can result in a substantially reduced price to the seller, or a higher price, depending upon the demand for the item. Further, it is quite possible that no one desires the item, so the seller must take the item back into his hand. There is also the possibility that the player will earn a $200 bonus if the proper digit is rolled on one of the dice.

When a property is sold, it is placed on the appropriate section of the 'board' - 25%, 50%, 75%, or 100% (there really isn't a board, just a card holder that indicates these sections). After a player sells properties, he may surrender one of the special 'buyer' cards and purchase from 1 - 3 cards from one of these markets. The player must pay the indicated price (based on the particular percentage market where the property is located) and take the property into his hand.

Again, there is a decision to be made here. Buyer cards are very valuable, as they can be used in a number of fashions:

1) Purchase properties, as described above;

2) Used as a 'wild' card to complete a set; or

3) Valued as $500.00 at the end of the game.

So, a player has to weigh the advantages of each of these options and play accordingly.

Buyer cards are purchases at auction in conjunction with a property card. When a Buyer card is revealed, another card is then revealed, and both cards are then auctioned together. The auction is a 'sealed' auction, however, so the stakes are often high as these cards carry tremendous advantages.

The game continues in this fashion until the property deck expires or a player calls an end to the game. One can only do this, however, if he has a total value (property sets plus cash) in excess of $5,000. Even then, a player should only do this when he feels he has more assets than any of his opponents.

As High Bid, this game was published for the 3M Bookshelf Series and 3M Gamette Series.

NAME: Volle Hütte
DESCRIPTION:
Players take on the role of club-owners vying for customers' Deutsch Marks in this unique board game, called Full House in German.

Each player is given a small board representing their cafe or pub. In your turn, you can either place a tile in your pub, representing different types of seating (bar, patio, formal) & activities (dancing, shooting pool, playing fooseball), or you can select a customer card, to draw in customers to those specific tiles, if you have the seating available. A third choice is to take a Billing card, which gives you a tip in cash money, and makes all customers in all the players bars pay their bills too. Yellow customers are worth 10 DM, red 20 DM and blue customers pay 30 DM.

When there are at least ten customers floating around, players can also spend a Action card which moves customers around. The cards either move off a specific tile type to a type you choose, or from a tile type you choose to a specific tile. So you might move customers specifically from the terrace seating to any other type of your choice (such as the disco floor), or from a tile of your choice (such as the bar) to specifically a Pool Table. The cards allow from 1-4 customers to move, depending on the tiles.

This is the clever part. As the customers move, they normally pay their bill, unless the Action card shows a No Pay symbol, making them bill-dodgers. When customers move, they first look for a suitable spot within the same pub! Only if they can't find one (either it lacks that type of tile, or there isn't enough room to accommodate them), do they then start wandering clockwise to the next pub, and keep going until they find a suitable spot. If they can't, they leave the game.

So if you have an Action card that pays a bill, and you have the right empty spaces in your bar (because you've carefully put in a variety of attractions), you move your customers around inside your bar and collect the money ("Hey, we're paying our bar tab now, we're gonna shoot some Pool"). If you have a suitable Action card with a No Pay symbol, you move customers from another player's bar into yours ("This place stinks guys, let's skip out and find a Fooseball!"). It is this clever management of customers that will net you big profits.

And if your bar is pretty full, especially with blue and red customers, you call a billing as your first action. The other players also collect, but you should have a margin on them, plus the tip (from 30-70 DM).

There are always three Customer cards and three Action cards face up, and two fresh tiles, so you should be able to make good choices and plan ahead a little. The game ends when the Action cards or the Billing cards are exhausted.

The winner is the player with the most money, having milked the punters as much as possible.

NAME: Ikusa
DESCRIPTION:
Shogun / Samurai Swords / Ikusa is the last game in the original Milton Bradley Gamemaster series. It focuses on the chaotic feudal society of Japan during the Middle Ages. Players play one of several factions that erupt into a civil war, trying to consolidate their strongholds and then defeat other armies for the right to be called Shogun, the supreme ruler.

In the game, players command forces on islands of feudal Japan.  Player forces include provincial forces in the provinces and mobile armies commanded by daimyos.  In each turn, players will allocate their koku into bids and purchases for the round.  The round begins with the allocation of turn order, which is determined by bid, and in the case of tied bids, by player agreement or random draw.  Then players other bids and payments are accounted for in purchases of castles and fortresses, drafting of new troops and ronin, and a bid for the lone ninja.  Following the bids phase, players in turn order plan and execute attacks against enemy territories, with attacks resolved through die rolls.  A player wins the game when he or she has captured a certain number of territories, either via straight conquest or by vanquishing the last of an opponent's diamyos and taking over that player's forces.

The game was originally published as Shogun and was later changed to Samurai Swords due to a name conflict with James Clavell's Shogun. Ikusa is the latest iteration of the game.

NAME: Space Beans
DESCRIPTION:
This game is a successor to the popular Bohnanza but is less complex and is not based on trading.

Players attempt to collect 30 points in "trophies" to win the game. This is accomplished by working with up to two collections of space beans - 1 public (face-up) and 1 secret (face-down).

The primary mechanic is drawing beans, placing them in one of your collections (public or secret) if you have any matching cards to play, then passing your entire hand to the player on your right. If you compile a collection that contains a number of beans equal to the number value on one of beans in the collection, you may redeem the collection for the same amount of points on that card.

For example: If a player has three violet beans, and one of them has a value of 3, that collection can be converted for three trophy points. The card numbered 3 would go into the trophy pile, and the other cards into the discard pile.

Space Beans is part of the Bohnanza family of games.

NAME: History of the World
DESCRIPTION:
History of the World works under the assumptions that all empires eventually fade and that the only things differentiating great empires from lesser ones is how much territory they conquer and how long it takes for their civilizations to disappear.  The game is played out over 7 epochs or rounds, from the ancient 3000 B.C. Sumerians to the pre-WW1 Germany, with every player controlling a new rising empire from history.  Some empires are stronger than others (like the Romans), but the game's clever mechanisms can help balance that out.  At the end of each epoch, players score points for all units of their color (from both the current and any previous empires) remaining on the board.

Gameplay:  Each player selects a color and takes all pieces of that color, as there are different miniatures for each of the 7 Epochs, these should be sorted by Epoch.  The game board is a stylized version of the globe.  The Event cards should be separated into Greater and Lesser Events.  Each player is dealt 3 Greater Events. These are either Minor Empires, Leaders, Weaponry or Reallocation.  Each player is also dealt 7 Lesser Events.  There are 22 different types of Lesser Events (Disasters, Diseases, and Special abilities, to name a few).  Players roll 2 dice and determine first player and begin drawing their first Epoch empires.  One unique mechanism is that the drawing player can examine their drawn empire and decide whether to keep it for themselves or give it to another player who hasn't gotten one yet.  If it is given to another player, the receiving player has no choice but to keep it for himself to play that Epoch.  Then the next player draws and makes his decision.  The player who gives their drawn Empire has to wait until given an empire by another player or until the last player draws.  Each Empire card contains the Empire name, how many troops the Empire has for expansion, the Empire's starting land space, if it has a Capitol or not (barbarian or nomadic nations frequently do not) and if it has any Navigation (Seas and Oceans to travel by).  One player reads out the Epochs Empires in order and turns are taken, in this roughly historical order, when a player's Empire is called.

Before the start of their turn a player may play up to two Event cards from their hand.  The Events played are resolved before the player starts his Empire's actions.  If the player's active Empire has navigation a ship token is placed in each sea or ocean listed (if an ocean is listed all adjacent seas to the ocean have ship markers put into them).  A Reallocation Greater Event allows an Empire with Navigation to exchange Fleets in seas and oceans for Coins that can be used to buy back defeated troops (1 coin per troop).  If the active Empire has a capitol it is taken and placed in the Empire's starting land with one unit of the Empire's available troops.

Since each land space may only contain one troop the player begins expanding from their starting land by placing troops in any adjacent land space that they wish to occupy or conquer.  To conquer a land the attacker moves one unit into the land space either from adjacent land or through a sea with a ship in it.  Then dice are rolled, the attacker gets 2 dice and the defender only one, unless the attacker traveled across a strait or the defender's land has either a forest, the great wall of China, or mountains on the border of the land that the attacker came from.  In this case the defender receives 2 dice as well.  If the attack comes from the sea the defender gets 3 dice for defense.  Highest score wins with ties killing off both the defender and attacker.  In this case the attacker can merely place the next troop, if he has any left, in the now-empty land space.

At any time the active Empire player may exchange an unplaced troop for a fort.  On later turns, a fort gives the player a +1 to defensive rolls in that land.  Also, if the defender in a fort loses or ties with an attacker only the fort is removed and the battle continues.  Whenever an army conquers a land with a capitol the capitol mini is flipped reducing it to a city (if it was a city to begin with it is removed from board when conquered).  After the active player's Empire is finished with it's actions check to see if it conquered to land spaces with resource symbols, if so it can build a monument.

Then scoring takes place.  Each area (Middle-East, Northern Europe, Eurasia, etc...) has a tile with 3 values for the current Epoch.  One value is for having a presence in the area (at least one land).  Another value is for having Dominance in the area (at least 2 lands and more than any other player in area). The last value is for having Control of an area (at least 3 lands and no other player has any in area).  These values vary from Epoch to Epoch and Area to Area (Middle-East is more valuable in early Epochs and fades in later Epochs, for example).  Total the scores from each area for all pieces of the player's color from all Empires controlled that remain on board.  Then add 2 points for each capitol controlled, 1 point per city and one point for each monument controlled. After all areas are scored the next Empire called takes its turn.

After all players have taken their turns and scored, for the first Epoch, the player with the highest score gets to take a pre-eminence marker and places it in front of him.  These are secret bonus points (worth somewhere from 3 to 6) for the end of the game and may not be examined till then.  This bonus to leader helps balance the Empire-draw mechanic and makes it valuable to score maximal points even early in the game, rather than tanking to get a better draw later. Then drawing begins for the next Epoch with the player having the lowest score drawing first on up to the person with the highest score drawing last (and likely being given a less than optimal Empire by another player).

Victory: After the last player has scored for Epoch 7 and the leader has drawn a pre-eminence marker, all players reveal their pre-eminence markers and add them to their scores.  The player with the highest score wins.

NAME: Icehouse
DESCRIPTION:
This is the game that introduced Icehouse Pieces.

This game doesn't use turns, or rounds, or anything else to break up the action.  Players place their pieces as quickly or slowly as they like, in attacking or defending positions.  Only when everyone's used up all their pieces is the game scored, with people getting points for their safe defenders and successful attackers.

NAME: Isi
DESCRIPTION:
Isi is a colorful abstract strategy game played on two levels.  On a basic level, each player is moving a pawn around the island of Isi, picking up tokens - there's a little strategy here, because which tokens you pick up are important, and one player's pawn can interfere with the other's.  But on another level, players are spending those tokens to build 'trade routes' between cities on the same island.  Cities grow as they become connected by trade routes, and at the end of the game whichever city's grown the most becomes the capital city; whoever is connected the most to the capital wins the game.

NAME: Knightmare Chess
DESCRIPTION:
Knightmare Chess adds a whole new element of unpredictability to the static game of standard Chess by giving players cards that they can play before, after, or sometimes instead of their turns. Some cards affect only a single move, while others change the entire game. Each card is assigned a point value, so you can build custom decks based on an agreed point total or handicap the match so that the better player has fewer powerful cards. Multiple variants are included in the rules.

Not for the weak willed, this game is mean.  The last player still standing wins.

This game is similar in nature to Elfenroads/Elfenland in that players try to visit as many cities as possible using optimal transportation cards; what's different is that the lay of the land is also dictated by card play.  Other players may interfere with your journey through the use of thieves, obstacles, and sea serpents.

NAME: Merchant of Venus
DESCRIPTION:
Merchant of Venus makes players take on the roles of space traders chasing wealth and fortune. Each player moves their ship through interconnected systems on a fixed map, discovering new alien worlds to trade with. As players start to make money delivering commodities, their earnings can be used to purchase equipment and construct their own infrastructure. The player who first acquires enough total value in cash and port/factory deeds wins the game.

The game uses a basic roll-and-move mechanism for movement, but modifies it with engine ship upgrades that let the players skip certain spaces during movement. When players reach cities and spaceports, they can buy and sell commodities. Different species are randomly distributed throughout the universe at the start of the game, and players will only uncover which species lives where through exploration in the course of the game - the layout of which species lives where works to offset the rigidity of the fixed map by making different routes through the map profitable each game.

The prices a player receives for selling their cargo is determined by the species that lives in the system, and what commodities a port offers for purchase is determined by a unique and dynamic supply-and-demand mechanism. With their money, players can replace their spaceships with better models, or build factories (which create better commodities) and spaceports (which speed up trading). They can also buy upgrades for their ships (like shields, lasers, or engines).

Variations included in the rulebook allow for interplayer combat and solo play, and the exact target wealth players have to acquire in order to win is decided on before each play.

NAME: Geronimo
DESCRIPTION:
The U.S. - Indian conflicts, a tragic period of history.

Each turn, players are randomly assigned a side to play -- either Indian tribes or the U.S. Only one player represents the U.S. each turn, while the other players each have a number of Indian tribes under their control. Indian players get to select one or two of their active tribes, but the rest are dealt to them randomly. There are usually more Indian tribes available than what are active each turn, but players don't really know which ones are inactive.  This can be unsettling to the U.S. player as he must decide where to deploy his limited troops and columns.

All players compete to earn victory points.  The U.S. player is faced with the task of building up sufficient resources (settlements, towns, railroads, mines, etc.) to maintain existing states and convert territories into states. The Indian players play the role of guerrillas to earn victory points, but also can deny resources to the U.S. player. However, he must be very careful not to suffer too many casualties, as this could cause his tribe to go on reservation or become extinct, which costs the player dearly in victory points.

NAME: Serenissima (first edition)
DESCRIPTION:
The Theme

In the fourteenth century, the Atlantic was an ocean without end and America was yet to be discovered. The Mediterranean was a sea of great prosperity - the only route between East and West. The greatest fleets of the age battled for the most lucrative trade routes.

Trade cities like Venice, Genoa, Barcelona or Istanbul grew as powerful as whole nations, establishing trade routes as far as North Africa or Middle East, bringing back Spice, Gems or Gold to the western Mediterranean. SERENISSIMA recreates this era, when the Mediterranean was at the centre of world trade.

The Game

Each players assume the role of one of those four city-states. Their goal is to establish their sphere of influence in the Mediterranean, and share all sorts of commodities to make their trading empire the most prosperous. In the course of a game, players must build galleys, hire crew and buy/sell commodities. The value of goods can be influenced by players having monopolies in certain commodities. Players can also take control of ports, thereby earning extra income from players using the port, as well as being able to get this port's specific commodity.

In the end, the scoring is based on the number of ports each player control, but also on the fact that those ports have commodities of different kind available. Ports come in three types : small, medium, and city-states. Whereas small ports are quite easy to satisfy (they need only two commodities to be considered "full"), the four starting city-states are far more difficult to please, as they will need all kind of commodities available (6 additional commodities, plus the one they produce).

During the course of the game, the number and type of commodities available in ports also controls the number of crew members you can hire, if you can build galleys or forts, and the price of commodities when you sell them. For example, a player won't be able to build new galleys until they have wood and iron available in one of the ports they control. Once a galley has been built, it has 5 spaces available, that can be filled by the crew or the goods. Every crew member allows movement through one space, and makes the galley more powerful. But those spaces are also needed to carry the goods that are worth money. Money that can be used to hire new crews, build new galleys, or commodities. A balance thus needs to be struck between trading commodities and taking control of ports - between a fleet of merchant galleys and a fleet of warships.

The game lasts between 5 to 8 turns depending on the number of active players. Turn order is defined by bidding. The winner of the bid choose whether he will play first, second, third or last. Depending on the situation and what the player wants to do, playing first or last might be equally interesting. For example, by playing first, a player would be unable to react to other players move, but he could avoid having his galleys blockaded.

NAME: Hannibal: Rome vs. Carthage
DESCRIPTION:
This game uses the very popular card system which first appeared in Avalon Hill's We the People game to detail the struggle between Carthage's Hannibal and the Roman Republic in approximately 200 BC.


(from Valley Games website:)

One of the greatest military commanders and tacticians in history descends on the Roman Empire once again. Do you face him as Rome and try to ward the invasion that comes from the North, or do you climb atop your war elephant and show Rome you will take that which they hold most dear: their territory.

Players use strategic-level cards for multiple purposes: moving generals, levying new troops, reinforcing existing armies, gaining political control of the provinces involved in the war, and generating historical events. When two armies meet on the battlefield, a second set of cards, called Battle Cards, are used to determine the winner. Ultimately both players seek victory by dominating both fronts: military and political.

NAME: Blackbeard
DESCRIPTION:
Introduction (from the rule book):

BLACKBEARD recreates "The Golden Age of Piracy" at the turn of the 18th century. Each player becomes one or more pirates and attempts to amass a fortune and retire before a King's Commissioner tracks him down, a Warship stumbles across him, or his own crew cuts his throat! Merchant ships plying the trade routes are the targets. Prizes range from near-worthless supplies to the fabulous Spanish and Mogul treasure ships. Luck, skill and cunning all play a part as you comb the Seven Seas (well ... at least three of them) for fame and fortune. Players should be aware that the game simulates 18th century piracy and therefore features random happenstance. Little can be planned. Players who are ready to strike when opportunity presents itself and are wily and aggressive without being rash will fare best in the long run.


Players take up the roles of famous pirates navigating the major sea lanes during the golden age of piracy.  Plunder and pirateering await as each player moves about on the map in a variable system through a deck of cards.  Rather than the normal turn order in games, players move when their designation is drawn in a deck.  When not in the role of their pirate they can take on the role of one of the English military ships hunting the sea for pirates.  By making shrewd choices and having some luck the player can end the game a wealthy and retired pirate with a large fleet of ships that have been accumulated over the years.

NAME: Britannia
DESCRIPTION:
Britannia is a historical board game that broadly depicts the millennia-long struggle for control of England, Scotland, and Wales. The game begins with the Roman invasion of 43 A.D., continues through the many struggles between Angles, Saxons, Picts, Norsemen, Scots, Irish, and other tribes, and ends with the Norman invasion of 1066.

Britannia allows players to re-create this epic history, re-enacting important battles in some cases, altering the course of history in others. The game rules discourage players from making historically unrealistic moves, but also give players the freedom to alter Great Britain’s history in important ways, creating countless interesting “what if?” scenarios. What if Boudicca’s Revolt against the Romans had been more successful? What if the Romans and the Romano-British had repelled the Saxon invasions of the 5th and 6th centuries? What if William the Conqueror had died during the Norman invasion of 1066?

In Britannia, the players will determine the destiny of a kingdom.

NAME: Junta
DESCRIPTION:
Players represent various families in Republica de los Bananas.

Each game turn has between 7 and 9 rounds, drawing cards, President assigns roles, foreign aid money is drawn, the president proposes a budget which is voted on, locations are chosen, there are assassination attempts, then the bank may be open or not, there may be a coup and aftermath, then the next round starts.

The game is for 4 to 7 players (although there are 2 and 3 player variants).  A president for life (El Presidente) is elected and then she or he allocates roles for all other players.  Depending upon his or her office and the various cards they hold, each player has a certain number of votes. These are important for the first vote to elect El Presidente and then there are votes each turn on the budget proposed by the President. The budget starts when the President draws 8 money cards face down from the money deck (which varies in denomination from $1 to $3) and proposes allocations. Not everyone will be included in the budget and the amounts are at the President's discretion. The President can keep undisclosed foreign aid money.

Players may attempt to assassinate the other players including the President by guessing where they will be from among five locations. Players who successfully assassinate another player take that player's unbanked money, the only safe money is the money that has been deposited in a players' Swiss bank account, and the only way to get to the bank is to survive the assassination round.

If players are unhappy, see an advantage, or just want to, and there is a 'coup excuse', they can start a coup. A coup sees players compete using armed forces to control a majority of the 5 power centers. Rebel players control the forces of the role which they were assigned prior to the coup  (e.g. army, navy, air force), and players loyal to the President do the same, seeking to control the strongholds until the coup is over. At the conclusion of each coup players who have control of the 5 power centres vote to be pro-President or pro-Junta determining if the President stays, or the Junta wins and elects a new President. And someone is sent to the firing squad.

Players assassinated or killed simply become another member of their family and begin again with new cards, but keeping any of their family's funds deposited in their Swiss bank account.

The game is won by whoever has the most pesos in their Swiss bank account when the money runs out.

NAME: Advanced Squad Leader
DESCRIPTION:
Advanced Squad Leader is the completely reorganized and re-designed version of the original Squad Leader system. While ASL is "advanced," it actually is a simpler game than the original Squad Leader became after the three follow-on gamettes. This three-ring binder is the basic rules for the entire system, and provides the ultimate combination of playability and detail. Full-color charts and beautiful pictures make this the most readable of rulebooks - and includes a full-service index as well for quick reference.

And ASL is more than "squads" - the system includes the rules for everything from machine guns to bazookas, tanks and ordnance weapons, paratrooper drops, glider landings and beach assaults. And much more. This set of rules is constantly kept up to date by expansions included with the modules.

ASL goals are scenario-defined, and vary from tasks such as exiting troops off of one edge of the board, to inflicting a certain number of casualty points on the opposing force, to capturing a certain number of goal buildings or areas.

This is just the rulebook. To start playing the game the newcomer must get, at least, the Beyond Valor: ASL Module 1. There are a great many ASL Modules available. "Core Modules" provide additional rules, units from different nationalities, and additional geomorphic mapboards. "Historical Modules" provide campaign games simulating multi-day battles using actual historical maps rather than geomorphic mapboards, including additional rules, counters, and paper maps. Many modules have dependencies on earlier modules.

NAME: Circus Maximus
DESCRIPTION:
From Battleline, the original publisher:

"The grandeur and decadence of ancient Rome in your living room! Thrill to the dust of chariot races, or the skillful bloodshed of gladiatorial combat. Circus Maximus is really TWO games in one. In the Chariot Race game you pick your team of horses, driver, and chariot car, each of which have special characteristics . . . In Gladiator, you pick up your weapons and step onto the bloodstained sands, simultaneously maneuvering, striking, and waiting for that fatal step that puts you inside your opponent's guard."

Battleline's Circus Maximus would later be developed by Don Greenwood and published in 1980 by Avalon Hill as separate titles: Circus Maximus and Gladiator.

Violent and bloody, Circus Maximus details the chariot races that occurred in ancient Rome.  Eight teams race around the track three times to determine victory.  Players prepare for the race by selecting the composition of their team of horses, their rider's skills, and the type of chariot that will be driven.  Once the race begins the players are free to do as they wish to hamper the other racers including whipping the rider, ramming chariots with scythed wheels, smashing into horses, and running over crashed opponents.  A campaign game of multiple races, in which players have to manage their teams and can increase their income by betting on races, is also possible.
